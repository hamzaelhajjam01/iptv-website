For Formula 1 fans, *how* you watch the race is almost as important as the race itself. Do you want the world-class analysis of the Sky Sports F1 team, or the data-rich feeds from F1 TV Pro?

The problem is, these are all separate, expensive subscriptions. IPTV solves this by bundling every F1 broadcast into one simple package.

## The F1 Fan's Problem: Split Broadcasts {#the-f1-fans-problem}

Watching F1 is confusing.
* In the **UK**, all races are exclusively on **Sky Sports F1**.
* In the **USA**, races are on **ESPN** and **ABC**.
* Globally, F1 offers its own **F1 TV Pro** app, which has live timing, data, and onboard cameras, but often features different commentary.

You're forced to choose one, and you're often geo-locked out of the others.

## The IPTV Solution: All Feeds, One App {#the-iptv-solution-all-feeds}

A premium IPTV service gives you *all* of these feeds. On race day, you can open your channel guide and choose which broadcast you want to watch.

### 1. Sky Sports F1 (The Premier Broadcast) {#feed-sky-sports-f1}

This is the gold standard for F1 coverage. Your IPTV subscription includes the full Sky Sports package, often in 4K. You get Martin Brundle's grid walk, expert pre-race analysis, and the main race feed. This is the broadcast most fans want to watch.

### 2. ESPN / ABC (USA Broadcast) {#feed-espn-abc}

For fans in the US, the standard ESPN feed is also included, so you can watch your local broadcast.

### 3. F1 TV Pro Feeds {#feed-f1-tv-pro}

Many IPTV services now also capture and stream the live feeds from the F1 TV Pro service. This means you can get channels dedicated to:
* Live Timing Data
* Driver Tracker
* Onboard Cameras for top drivers

This allows you to create your own "pit wall" experience by having the main race on your TV and the data feed on your tablet.

## Never Miss a Race, Practice, or Qualifying {#never-miss-a-race}

With IPTV, you don't just get the main race. You get the entire race weekend. All the practice sessions (FP1, FP2, FP3) and the full Qualifying broadcast are available.
