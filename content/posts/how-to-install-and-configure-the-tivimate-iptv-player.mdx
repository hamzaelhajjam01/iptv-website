faqs:
  - q: "Is TiviMate free to use?"
    a: "TiviMate offers a free version with basic functionality. However, the most popular features, like multi-playlist support and a customizable EPG, require a one-time TiviMate Premium purchase."
  - q: "Does TiviMate provide any channels or movies?"
    a: "No. TiviMate is just a video player. It is very powerful, but it is empty. You must provide your own IPTV subscription, like one from our [pricing](/pricing) page, to add content to it."
  - q: "What is an 'Xtream Codes' login?"
    a: "This is the most common login method for IPTV services. Your provider will give you a Username, Password, and a Server URL. TiviMate uses these three details to log in and automatically fetch all your channels and EPG data."
  - q: "Why is my playlist not loading in TiviMate?"
    a: "This is almost always a typo. Double-check your Username, Password, and Server URL. Ensure there are no extra spaces and that `http://` is at the beginning of the URL. If you're still stuck, visit our [Help Center](/help)."

If you've been in the IPTV world for a while, you've heard of TiviMate. It's widely considered one of the most powerful, stable, and user-friendly IPTV players on the market. Unlike free apps, TiviMate is designed to feel like a premium cable box, with a clean EPG (Electronic Program Guide) and fast channel switching.

This guide will show you how to install TiviMate and, more importantly, how to configure it with your IPTV subscription.

## Why Choose TiviMate? {#why-choose-tivimate}

TiviMate's popularity comes from its premium feel and features:
* **A Modern EPG:** A clean, grid-style TV guide that's easy to read.
* **High Performance:** It's fast, stable, and less prone to crashing than many free apps.
* **Customization:** You can customize channel groups, favorites, and EPG settings.
* **Multi-Playlist Support:** (Premium feature) You can add multiple IPTV services to one app.

## How to Install TiviMate {#how-to-install-tivimate}

How you install TiviMate depends on your device.

### Method 1: Google Play Store (For Android TV) {#install-play-store}

If you have an Android TV Box (like an Nvidia Shield or Chromecast with Google TV), this is the easiest way:
1.  Open the **Google Play Store**.
2.  Search for **"TiviMate"**.
3.  Click **"Install"**.

### Method 2: Sideloading (For Amazon Firestick) {#install-sideloading}

TiviMate is **not** on the Amazon Appstore. You must sideload it using the "Downloader" app.
1.  Enable "Apps from Unknown Sources" on your Firestick.
2.  Install the **"Downloader"** app from the Amazon Appstore.
3.  Open Downloader and, in the URL bar, type the official TiviMate downloader code: **36697** (This is the developer's official shortcut link).
4.  Click "Go." The app will download and ask you to install it.

## How to Configure TiviMate (Adding Your Playlist) {#how-to-configure-tivimate}

Once TiviMate is installed, it will be empty. You need to add your IPTV service credentials.

### Step 1: Open TiviMate & Select 'Add Playlist' {#step-1-add-playlist}

When you open the app for the first time, it will immediately show a blue screen with an "Add Playlist" button. Select it.

### Step 2: Choose Your Login Method (Xtream Codes) {#step-2-login-method}

TiviMate will ask what kind of playlist you have. You can use an "M3U Link," but the best and most reliable method is "Xtream Codes." Select **"Xtream Codes"**.

### Step 3: Enter Your Details {#step-3-enter-details}

Your IPTV provider (like us) will send you three pieces of information in your welcome email:
1.  **Server URL:** (Looks like `http://example.com:1234`)
2.  **Username:** (Case-sensitive)
3.  **Password:** (Case-sensitive)

Enter these three details *exactly* as they were given to you.
* You do **not** need to enter an EPG URL. The Xtream Codes login does this automatically.
* Click **"Next"**.

TiviMate will "process" your details and then show "Playlist is processed." Your channels and TV guide will now load automatically.

## What About TiviMate Premium? {#tivimate-premium}

The free version of TiviMate works but is very limited. To unlock the app's full potential, you'll need to buy TiviMate Premium. You can do this by installing the "TiviMate Companion" app on a separate Android phone or tablet via the Google Play Store.
