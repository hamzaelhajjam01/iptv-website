faqs:
  - q: "Is the 'Smart IPTV' (SIPTV) app free?"
    a: "No. The app itself is developed by a third party and is not free. It offers a 7-day free trial, after which it requires a one-time activation fee of around 5.49 EUR (about $6) to be paid to the app developer."
  - q: "Does my IPTV provider own the 'Smart IPTV' app?"
    a: "No. This is a very common point of confusion. The 'Smart IPTV' (SIPTV) app is a third-party player, just like VLC. You must purchase the app and an IPTV subscription separately."
  - q: "What is a TV MAC Address?"
    a: "A MAC address is a unique 12-character ID assigned to your TV's network adapter. The Smart IPTV app uses this ID to identify your specific TV and load the correct playlist."
  - q: "This seems complicated. Can I get help?"
    a: "Yes, this is an advanced setup, and our team is happy to walk you through it. Visit our [Help Center](/help) and provide your M3U link and TV MAC address, and we can assist."

Setting up IPTV on a Samsung Smart TV is slightly different from Android devices or Firesticks. Samsung's "Tizen" operating system doesn't use the Google Play Store, so you can't "sideload" apps.

Instead, you must use a specific app from the Samsung App Store. The most popular and stable app for this is **'Smart IPTV' (SIPTV)**. This guide will show you how to set it up.

## The Challenge: Samsung's Tizen OS {#the-challenge-samsungs-tizen-os}

Unlike Android, Samsung's Tizen OS is a "closed" system. This means you can only install apps approved by Samsung and listed in their official App Store. This limits your options, but fortunately, there are excellent players available.

## The Best App: 'Smart IPTV' (SIPTV) {#the-best-app-smart-iptv-siptv}

The 'Smart IPTV' (SIPTV) app is the most recommended player for Samsung TVs. It's stable, fast, and fully compatible with most IPTV providers.

**Important:** This app is a *player*, not a *service*. It is **not free**. It offers a 7-day free trial, after which it requires a one-time activation fee of ~5.49 EUR, which you pay directly to the app's developer (not your IPTV provider).

## Step 1: Install the 'Smart IPTV' App {#step-1-install-the-app}

1.  Press the "Smart Hub" (home) button on your Samsung remote.
2.  Navigate to **"Apps"**.
3.  Search for **"Smart IPTV"** (it has a blue icon).
4.  Install and launch the app.

## Step 2: Find Your TV's MAC Address {#step-2-find-your-tv-mac-address}

When you first launch the app, it will show a "Loading..." screen. On the right side, it will display your **"TV MAC Address"**. It will look something like `aa:bb:cc:11:22:33`.

**Write this MAC address down. You will need it.**

If you miss this screen, you can find the MAC address by going to the app's **Settings**.

## Step 3: Upload Your M3U Playlist {#step-3-upload-your-m3u-playlist}

This step is done on your **computer or phone**, not your TV.

When you sign up for an IPTV service, your provider will send you an **M3U Link** (e.g., `http://example.com/get.php?username=...`). Copy this link.

1.  Go to the SIPTV website: `siptv.app/mylist/`
2.  Find the section titled "Upload playlist File or external playlist URL with auto-update."
3.  In the **MAC** field, type the MAC address you wrote down from Step 2.
4.  In the **URL** (Link) field, paste your M3U Link.
5.  Click the **"Send"** (or "Upload") button.

## Step 4: Restart the App {#step-4-restart-the-app}

Go back to your Samsung TV. Exit the 'Smart IPTV' app completely (hold the "back" button) and then re-open it. If the upload was successful, the app will now display "Loading channels..." and your playlist will appear.

## Alternative Apps {#alternative-apps}

Other apps like "IPTV Smarters Player" (sometimes listed as "Smarters Player Lite") are also available on the Samsung App Store and may be easier to use, as they often support the "Xtream Codes" (Username/Password/URL) login method.

If this process seems too complex, don't worry. Our support team can walk you through it. Just visit our [Help Center](/help) with your M3U link and TV MAC address.
