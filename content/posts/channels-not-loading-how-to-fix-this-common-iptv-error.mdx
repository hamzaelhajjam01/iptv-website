faqs:
  - q: "Why does my IPTV say 'Check Playlist' or 'Error 404'?"
    a: "This means the app cannot connect to the server URL. This is almost always a typo in your login details (Server URL, Username, or Password) or an expired subscription."
  - q: "Can my ISP block my IPTV channels from loading?"
    a: "Yes. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) actively block the server URLs of known IPTV providers. A VPN is the most effective way to bypass this block."
  - q: "What does 'refresh your playlist' mean?"
    a: "In apps like IPTV Smarters or TiviMate, there is an option in the settings to 'Reload Playlist' or 'Update Channels.' This forces the app to re-download the channel list from the server."

You open your IPTV app, ready to watch a show, but instead of your channel list, you're hit with an error: "Channels Not Loading," "Check Playlist," or a "404 Error."

This is a very common issue, and it's almost always a simple login or connection problem. Here’s how to troubleshoot and fix it.

## Why Are My Channels Not Loading? (The 4 Main Causes) {#why-channels-not-loading}

1.  **Typo in Login Details:** This is the #1 cause. Your Username, Password, or Server URL is entered incorrectly. They are case-sensitive!
2.  **ISP Block:** Your Internet Service Provider (e.g., Rogers, Comcast, BT) is actively blocking your connection to the IPTV server.
3.  **Expired Subscription:** Your account may be expired, so the server is refusing your login.
4.  **Internet Outage:** Your device itself may not be connected to the internet.

## How to Fix the 'Channels Not Loading' Error {#how-to-fix-channels-not-loading}

### Fix 1: Check Your Login Details (The #1 Cause) {#fix-1-check-login-details}

Go back to your welcome email and meticulously check your credentials.
* **Username:** Is it `User123` or `user123`? It's **case-sensitive**.
* **Password:** Check for case-sensitivity and special characters.
* **Server URL:** This is where most errors happen. Make sure you include the `http://` at the beginning and the correct port number at the end (e.g., `:1234`). Do **not** add extra spaces.

### Fix 2: Reboot Your Device and Router {#fix-2-reboot-device}

Just like with buffering, a simple reboot fixes many connection errors. Unplug your modem, router, and streaming device. Wait 60 seconds, plug them back in, and try again.

### Fix 3: Refresh Your Playlist in the App {#fix-3-refresh-playlist}

Most IPTV players (like TiviMate or Smarters) have a feature to "Reload Playlist," "Update Channels," or "Refresh EPG." You can usually find this in the app's settings. This forces the app to re-download the channel list from the server.

### Fix 4: Check Your Internet Connection {#fix-4-check-internet}

Open a different app on your device, like YouTube or a web browser. Can you load a video or a website? If not, your device isn't connected to the internet, and that's your problem.

### Fix 5: Use a VPN to Bypass ISP Blocks {#fix-5-use-a-vpn}

If you've confirmed your login is 100% correct and your internet is working, your ISP is likely blocking the connection. This is very common.
1.  Install a reputable VPN on your device.
2.  Connect to a server in a nearby location.
3.  Restart your IPTV app.
The VPN will encrypt your connection, making it invisible to your ISP and bypassing the block.

### Fix 6: Contact Support {#fix-6-contact-support}

If none of these steps work, it's time to contact your provider. Your subscription might have expired, or their server might be temporarily down for maintenance. Our team is available 24/7 at our [Help Center](/help) to check your account status.
