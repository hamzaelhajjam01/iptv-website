faqs:
  - q: "Is 'Xtream Codes' an app? Can I download it?"
    a: "No. Xtream Codes is not an app. It is a 'login method' or 'API.' It's the set of 3 credentials (username, password, server URL) that you enter into a separate player app like TiviMate or IPTV Smarters."
  - q: "Do I need an EPG link if I use Xtream Codes?"
    a: "No, and this is its biggest advantage. The Xtream Codes login automatically provides your channel list, VOD library, and EPG (TV Guide) all in one simple login. You don't need to add M3U or EPG links."
  - q: "Where do I get my Xtream Codes?"
    a: "Your IPTV provider (like us) will send them to you in your welcome email after you sign up for a subscription."
  - q: "My Xtream Codes login failed. What do I do?"
    a: "This is almost always a typo. Double-check your Username, Password, and Server URL. They are case-sensitive. Also, make sure the `http://` is at the beginning of the URL. If it still fails, contact support at our [Help Center](/help)."

When you sign up for an IPTV service, you will be given your login credentials. You'll see terms like "M3U Link" and "Xtream Codes API." While M3U is an option, **Xtream Codes** is by far the easiest, fastest, and most reliable way to log in.

This guide explains what Xtream Codes are and how to use them.

## What Are 'Xtream Codes'? {#what-are-xtream-codes}

Xtream Codes is **not an app**. You cannot "download" Xtream Codes.

It is a **login method** (or API) used by the most popular IPTV players. It's a simple and powerful way for your player app to communicate with your IPTV provider's server.

Instead of forcing you to copy and paste long, complicated M3U playlist URLs and separate EPG links, the Xtream Codes login just requires three simple pieces of information.

## Why Are Xtream Codes Better Than an M3U Link? {#why-are-xtream-codes-better-than-m3u}

* **M3U Link:** This is just a basic playlist file. You often have to add a *second* link for your EPG (TV Guide). If the provider updates something, you may need to re-download the link.
* **Xtream Codes:** This is a "smart" login. You enter your credentials once, and the app automatically fetches your channels, your VOD (Video on Demand) library, and your EPG, all in one step. It's a "one-and-done" solution.

## The 3 Parts of Your Xtream Codes Login {#the-3-parts-of-your-xtream-codes-login}

When you sign up for a service, your provider will email you your Xtream Codes. It will always consist of three parts:

1.  **Username:** (e.g., `user12345`)
2.  **Password:** (e.g., `Pass54321`)
3.  **Server URL:** (e.g., `http://provider-url.com:1234`)

That's it. This is all you need to log in to almost any modern IPTV app.

## How to Use Your Xtream Codes {#how-to-use-your-xtream-codes}

When you open your IPTV player (like TiviMate, IPTV Smarters, or IPTVX):

1.  Always look for the "Add Playlist" or "Add User" button.
2.  When given the choice, always select **"Login with Xtream Codes API"** (it may be called "Login with Username and Password").
3.  You will see three fields (plus a "Name" field, which you can fill with anything).
4.  Carefully enter your **Username**, **Password**, and **Server URL** exactly as they were given to you.
5.  Click "Login" or "Add User."

The app will do the rest.

## What If My App Only Supports M3U? {#what-if-my-app-only-supports-m3u}

Some apps, like the 'Smart IPTV' (SIPTV) app for Samsung and LG TVs or VLC Player, do not support the Xtream Codes login. For these apps, your provider will also give you an M3U link, which you can use instead.
