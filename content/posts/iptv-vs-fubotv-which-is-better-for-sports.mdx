faqs:
  - q: "What is the biggest problem with FuboTV for sports fans?"
    a: "FuboTV is missing all Turner-owned channels. This means it does not have TNT or TBS, so you cannot watch many nationally televised NBA, NHL, or MLB playoff games."
  - q: "Does FuboTV still have sports blackouts?"
    a: "Yes. FuboTV is 100% legal, which means it must obey all local and national blackout rules. If a game is blacked out in your area, you cannot watch it on FuboTV."
  - q: "Is FuboTV cheaper than IPTV?"
    a: "No. The base FuboTV 'Pro' plan starts at $84.99 per month, plus a potential Regional Sports Fee. A premium IPTV subscription typically costs a fraction of that for an entire year."
  - q: "Can I get Regional Sports Networks (RSNs) on IPTV?"
    a: "Yes. Premium IPTV services include the local RSNs (like Bally Sports, YES Network, etc.) from all markets. This allows you to bypass blackouts by watching the game on another city's feed."

If you're a cord-cutter looking for live sports, you've seen ads for FuboTV. It markets itself as the "sports-first" streaming service, a direct competitor to cable.

But how does it *really* compare to a premium IPTV service? When you look past the marketing, Fubo's "sports-first" claim has some major holes that IPTV is designed to fill.

## FuboTV: The 'Sports-First' Cable Alternative {#what-is-fubotv}

FuboTV is a 100% legal, subscription-based streaming service in the US, Canada, and Spain. Its main selling point is that its base "Pro" plan includes a wide range of national sports channels (like ESPN, FS1, NFL Network) and, most importantly, many **Regional Sports Networks (RSNs)** (like Bally Sports, NBC Sports, etc.) for watching your local teams.

## IPTV: The 'All-in-One' Global Stream {#what-is-iptv}

A premium IPTV service is different. It's a single subscription that bundles *all* global channels into one package. This includes all the channels Fubo has, plus thousands more from around the world, as well as a massive Video-on-Demand (VOD) library.

## Head-to-Head Comparison: Sports & Features {#head-to-head-comparison}

### Sports Channel Lineup (The Big Gaps) {#comparison-channel-lineup}

* **FuboTV:** Has a great *base* package for sports, including ESPN, FS1, and NFL Network. It's one of the few services with many RSNs. However, FuboTV is **missing all Turner channels**. This is a massive gap, as it means **you get no TNT and no TBS**. For sports fans, this means you will miss a huge number of national NBA games, MLB playoff games, and NHL games.
* **IPTV:** A premium IPTV service includes *everything*. You get all the channels Fubo has, *plus* TNT, TBS, and all the "League Pass" and PPV channels. You also get international sports feeds, like Sky Sports and beIN Sports.

### Blackout Restrictions (The Deal-Breaker) {#comparison-blackouts}

* **FuboTV:** Because it's a legal, licensed service, FuboTV **must enforce all blackout rules**. If your local MLB team is playing, it will be blacked out on both MLB.tv *and* the national feed, forcing you to watch on your specific RSN. If you're traveling, you may be blacked out from your home team.
* **IPTV:** **IPTV has no blackouts.** This is its biggest advantage. Because your subscription gives you the RSNs from *every* city, you can bypass any blackout. If the Lakers game is blacked out in Los Angeles, you just switch to the feed from San Diego or the opponent's home city.

### Price and Value {#comparison-price}

* **FuboTV:** This is a premium service with a premium price. The base "Pro" plan starts at **$84.99 per month** (after a recent price hike), and you may have to pay an additional **Regional Sports Fee of $12-$16 per month**.
* **IPTV:** A premium, 12-month IPTV plan often costs less than *two months* of FuboTV. When you compare our [pricing](/pricing), the value is clear.

## The Verdict: Which is *Actually* Better for Sports? {#the-verdict}

**For Casual Fans:** FuboTV is a good, legal option if you want to watch *some* sports, need a cloud DVR, and aren't concerned with the high monthly cost or the missing Turner channels.

**For Die-Hard Sports Fans:** **IPTV is the undisputed winner.** It is the only way to get *every* game, from *every* league (including all RSNs and PPVs), with **zero blackouts**, all in one subscription for a fraction of the price.
