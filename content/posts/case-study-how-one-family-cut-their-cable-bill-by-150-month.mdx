Meet the Johnson family—two adults, two kids, and one very high cable bill. Like millions of others, they were stuck in a cycle: their "promotional" cable rate expired, and their bill jumped to **over $200 per month**.

They were paying for a 150-channel package but, in reality, they only watched about 15 of them. This is their story of how they cut the cord and cut their bill by over $150/month.

## The Problem: A $200/Month Cable Bill {#the-problem-a-200-month-cable-bill}

The Johnsons' monthly bill was broken down like this:
* **"Triple Play" Package:** $160
* **Hardware Rental (2 boxes):** $25
* **Broadcast & Regional Sports Fees:** $22.50
* **Total:** **$207.50/month** (or $2,490 per year)

They were frustrated. They were paying for hundreds of channels they never watched, just to get the few they did—local news, a few sports networks, and kids' channels.

## The 'Aha' Moment: Discovering IPTV {#the-aha-moment-discovering-iptv}

The family already owned an Amazon Firestick 4K for their living room TV, which they used for Netflix. After some research, they learned they could use that same device to get a premium IPTV subscription.

They signed up for a service (like ours) that offered over 15,000 channels, all the local networks, all premium sports packages, and a massive VOD library.

## The Cost Breakdown: Before and After {#the-cost-breakdown-before-and-after}

Here is the simple math. The family's needs: a plan that could be watched on 2 TVs at the same time (a "2-connection" plan).

**Before (Cable):**
* **Cost:** **$207.50 / month**
* **Channels:** ~150
* **VOD Library:** No

**After (IPTV):**
* **Cost:** A 2-connection plan, paid annually (see our [pricing](/pricing) for examples), breaks down to a tiny fraction of their old bill.
* **Channels:** 15,000+
* **VOD Library:** 60,000+ movies and series
* **Total Savings:** **Over $150 per month**

## The Benefits: More Than Just Savings {#the-benefits-more-than-just-savings}

The family didn't just save money; they got a massive upgrade.

### More Content for Everyone {#more-content-for-everyone}
The kids got a dedicated 24/7 kids' channel section. The parents got all the premium movie channels and international news. And they got all the sports packages, which would have cost *another* $100/month from their cable company.

### Multi-Room, One Price {#multi-room-one-price}
They bought a second, inexpensive Firestick for their bedroom TV. With their 2-connection plan, they could now watch different shows in different rooms at the same time, all under one low-cost subscription.

By switching to IPTV, the Johnsons not only saved over $1,800 a year but also got a service that was more flexible and packed with 100x more content.
