faqs:
  - q: "Is it safe to watch IPTV on my iPhone?"
    a: "Yes, it is perfectly safe. The apps are downloaded from the official Apple App Store, and you are simply streaming video content, just like with YouTube or Netflix."
  - q: "Will IPTV use all my mobile data?"
    a: "IPTV streams video, so it does use a significant amount of data, especially with HD or 4K streams. It is highly recommended to be connected to a Wi-Fi network."
  - q: "Can I watch my IPTV on both my TV and my iPhone at the same time?"
    a: "This depends on your subscription. Most standard IPTV plans only allow one connection at a time. If you try to watch on two devices, you may get a connection error."
  - q: "The app is not working, what should I do?"
    a: "First, double-check your login credentials (username, password, and server URL). If they are correct, try restarting the app and checking your internet connection. For more help, visit our [Help Center](/help)."

Yes, you can absolutely watch your full IPTV subscription on your iPhone or iPad. This turns your device into a powerful, portable television, allowing you to access all your live channels and movies from anywhere with a good internet connection.

Unlike "sideloading" on Android, the process on iOS is incredibly simple and secure. You just need to download a player app from the official Apple App Store and log in.

## How Does IPTV Work on iOS? {#how-does-iptv-work-on-ios}

Your IPTV subscription provides you with login details. You just need a "player" app to handle those credentials and play the stream. The Apple App Store has many excellent, free players to choose from. You download one, enter your login details, and your content will appear.

## The Easiest Way: Step-by-Step Guide {#easiest-way-step-by-step}

We recommend using the "Xtream Codes API" login, as it's the simplest and automatically syncs your EPG (TV Guide).

### Step 1: Download an IPTV Player from the App Store {#step-1-download-player}

Go to the **App Store** on your iPhone or iPad and search for an IPTV player. We recommend **"Smarters Player Lite"** as it's free, reliable, and easy to configure. Download it.

### Step 2: Choose 'Login with Xtream Codes' {#step-2-choose-xtream-codes}

Open the "Smarters Player Lite" app. It will ask you to add a new user. You will see several options, including "Load M3U Playlist" and "Login with Xtream Codes API."

Select **"Login with Xtream Codes API"**.

### Step 3: Enter Your Credentials {#step-3-enter-credentials}

This screen will ask for four pieces of information. You can find your login details in the welcome email from your IPTV provider.

1.  **Any Name:** This is just a label. You can type "My TV."
2.  **Username:** (Your provider's username)
3.  **Password:** (Your provider's password)
4.  **Server URL:** (Your provider's server URL, e.g., `http://example.com:1234`)

Tap **"Add User"**. The app will verify your login and immediately start downloading your channel list and EPG. You can now tap on the user profile you just created to start watching.

## Recommended Apps for iPhone and iPad {#recommended-apps}

* **Smarters Player Lite:** Free, easy, and reliable. Uses the Xtream Codes login.
* **IPTV Player Live:** A very popular and well-designed free player.
* **GSE Smart IPTV:** A more advanced player that can handle any playlist format.

## A Note on Using Mobile Data {#note-on-using-mobile-data}

Streaming live TV uses a lot of data. While you *can* use your mobile data (4G/5G), it is strongly recommended to be connected to a stable **Wi-Fi network** to avoid using your entire data allowance and to prevent buffering.
