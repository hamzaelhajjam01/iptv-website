faqs:
  - q: "How can I watch all 380 Premier League games?"
    a: "In the UK, it's impossible, as not all games are broadcast. In the US, all 380 games are available across Peacock, USA Network, and NBC. IPTV services bundle all of these US and UK channels so you can watch any game you want."
  - q: "What is the 3 PM blackout?"
    a: "The 3 PM blackout is a rule in the UK that prohibits Saturday 3 PM matches from being shown on live TV. This is done to encourage fans to attend local lower-league games in person."
  - q: "How does IPTV let me watch 3 PM blackout games?"
    a: "The 3 PM blackout only applies in the UK. These games *are* broadcast live in other countries, like the US (on Peacock) and Canada. IPTV gives you access to these international channel feeds, allowing you to bypass the UK blackout."
  - q: "Do I need a VPN to watch EPL on IPTV?"
    a: "It is highly recommended. A VPN hides your streaming from your ISP (to prevent throttling) and can bypass geo-restrictions, allowing you to access feeds from other countries."

For fans of the English Premier League (EPL), watching every game is a confusing and expensive challenge. In the UK, rights are split between Sky Sports and TNT Sports, and the infamous "3 PM blackout" means many games aren't shown live at all. In the US, you need subscriptions to Peacock, USA Network, and NBC to get all the matches.

IPTV simplifies all of this by consolidating every necessary channel from around the world into one subscription.

## The Problem: Fragmented Rights & 3 PM Blackouts {#the-problem-epl-blackouts}

No single broadcaster in one country has the perfect package. UK fans are subject to the 3 PM Saturday blackout, meaning they can't watch several matches live. US fans get all 380 games, but they are spread across multiple cable and streaming platforms.

## The IPTV Solution: All Feeds in One Place {#the-iptv-solution}

A premium IPTV service gives you the "best of both worlds" by providing the channel feeds from *both* the UK and the US.

### For UK Fans: Bypassing the 3 PM Blackout {#solution-for-uk-fans}

This is the biggest advantage. The 3 PM blackout does not exist in the United States or Canada. With IPTV, you can simply tune into the **Peacock** or **USA Network** feed (which are part of your subscription) and watch the 3 PM game that is "blacked out" on Sky Sports.

### For US Fans: One Home for Peacock, USA, and NBC {#solution-for-us-fans}

Instead of paying for a cable package *and* a Peacock subscription, IPTV bundles it all. You get all the cable channels (like USA Network) and the streaming-only matches all in one place.

## What Channels Should I Look For? {#what-channels-to-look-for}

Your IPTV subscription should include all of these to guarantee 100% coverage:
* **UK Feeds:** Sky Sports, TNT Sports
* **US Feeds:** Peacock, USA Network, NBC
* **Canadian Feeds:** Fubo (which carries EPL in Canada)

By having all these options, you can pick your favorite commentary or bypass any regional restriction. Check our [channels and features](/channels-features) page to see the full lineup of international sports broadcasters we offer.
