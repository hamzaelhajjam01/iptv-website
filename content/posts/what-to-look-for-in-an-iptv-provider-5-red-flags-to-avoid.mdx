faqs:
  - q: "What is the biggest red flag for an IPTV service?"
    a: "The 'Lifetime Subscription.' These are almost always scams. Reputable providers have ongoing server and content costs, so a one-time 'lifetime' fee is not a sustainable business model. The service will almost certainly disappear."
  - q: "Is 'no free trial' a red flag?"
    a: "Yes. A confident provider who has stable servers will always offer a 24-48 hour free trial (or a very cheap 1-day pass). This lets you test the stream quality during peak hours. Avoid services that demand a 3-month or 1-year payment upfront."
  - q: "Does a high channel count (like 20,000+) mean a better service?"
    a: "Not at all. In fact, it can be a red flag for an unstable server. Stability is far more important than channel count. A stable service with 10,000 channels is better than a buffering service with 25,000."

The IPTV market is flooded with providers, but 90% of them are low-quality resellers with unstable servers. Choosing the right one is the difference between a smooth, buffer-free experience and a folder of dead links.

Before you spend any money, learn to spot the warning signs. Here are the 5 biggest red flags to avoid.

## The Most Important Factor: Stability Over Everything {#stability-over-everything}

Don't be fooled by a massive channel count. A provider offering 25,000 channels is useless if they all buffer during the big game. The *only* thing that matters is **stream stability**. This comes from high-quality servers and good network management—not a long channel list.

## The 5 Red Flags to Avoid {#the-5-red-flags-to-avoid}

### Red Flag #1: The 'Lifetime Subscription' Scam {#red-flag-1-lifetime-scam}

This is the biggest and most common scam in IPTV. A provider will offer "lifetime access" for a one-time fee of $100-$500. This is not a sustainable business. Real providers have monthly costs for servers, bandwidth, and content.

These "lifetime" services are designed to sign up as many people as possible, collect the money, and then **disappear 3-6 months later**, leaving you with nothing.

### Red Flag #2: No Free Trial {#red-flag-2-no-free-trial}

A confident provider *wants* you to test their service. They know their streams are stable. They will always offer a **24-48 hour free trial** or a cheap 1-day pass. This is crucial for *you* to test the service during peak hours (like a Sunday afternoon during NFL season).

If a provider's only options are 3-month, 6-month, or 1-year plans with no trial, **avoid them**. They are likely hiding their unstable servers.

### Red Flag #3: Bad or Missing Customer Support {#red-flag-3-bad-support}

When your service inevitably has an issue, you need help.
* **Red Flag:** The only "support" is a generic email address or a contact form.
* **Green Flag:** The provider offers **24/7 live chat**, a Discord server, or a WhatsApp number. This shows they have a real team dedicated to helping you.

### Red Flag #4: No EPG or a Broken VOD Library {#red-flag-4-no-epg}

A good provider invests in the *full experience*, which includes a working EPG (Electronic Program Guide) and a well-organized VOD (Video on Demand) library.

If a provider's EPG is always "unavailable" or their VOD library is just a jumbled mess of 50,000 files, it means they are a cheap, low-effort reseller.

### Red Flag #5: 'Crypto Only' or Unsafe Payments {#red-flag-5-unsafe-payments}

While many users *prefer* to pay with crypto for privacy, it should not be the *only* option. A total lack of traditional payment methods (like credit cards) can be a red flag that they are unable to get approved by any payment processor.

## The Green Flags: What to Look For {#what-to-look-for}

So, what should you look for? A good provider will have:
* ✅ **A Free Trial:** They are confident in their product.
* ✅ **Stable Servers:** They advertise "Anti-Freeze" tech and have good reviews.
* ✅ **A Working EPG/VOD:** The service is clean and well-organized.
* ✅ **24/7 Support:** There's a real team you can contact.
* ✅ **Transparent Pricing:** Clear, simple subscription plans.
