faqs:
  - q: "Is the 'Smart IPTV' (SIPTV) app free?"
    a: "No. The app is a third-party player and is not free. It comes with a 7-day free trial, after which you must pay a one-time activation fee of around 5.49 EUR to the app developer."
  - q: "Is this app the same as my IPTV subscription?"
    a: "No. The 'Smart IPTV' app is only a media player. You must buy the app (one-time fee) and an IPTV subscription (monthly/yearly) from a provider like us."
  - q: "What is a MAC Address and why do I need it?"
    a: "A MAC address is a unique ID for your LG TV's network adapter. The Smart IPTV app uses this ID to identify your TV and load your specific M3U playlist."
  - q: "This is confusing. Can I get help?"
    a: "Yes, this is an advanced setup, and we are happy to help. Visit our [Help Center](/help) with your M3U link and TV MAC address, and our team can assist you."

Setting up IPTV on an LG Smart TV is very similar to a Samsung TV. LG's "webOS" operating system is a closed system, meaning you can only install apps from the official LG Content Store.

The most common and reliable app for LG TVs is **'Smart IPTV' (SIPTV)**. This guide will show you how to set it up.

## The Challenge: LG's webOS {#the-challenge-lgs-webos}

Because webOS is not Android, you cannot "sideload" .apk files. You must use an app from the LG Content Store. This limits your choices, but the 'Smart IPTV' app is a powerful and stable option.

## The Best App: 'Smart IPTV' (SIPTV) {#the-best-app-smart-iptv-siptv}

The 'Smart IPTV' (SIPTV) app is the most recommended player for LG Smart TVs.

**Important:** This app is a *player*, not a *service*. It is **not free**. It offers a 7-day free trial, after which it requires a one-time activation fee of ~5.49 EUR, which you pay directly to the app's developer (not your IPTV provider).

## Step 1: Install the 'Smart IPTV' App {#step-1-install-the-app}

1.  Press the "Home" button on your LG Magic Remote.
2.  Navigate to the **"LG Content Store"**.
3.  In the search bar, type **"Smart IPTV"**.
4.  Install the app (it has a blue icon).

## Step 2: Find Your TV's MAC Address {#step-2-find-your-tv-mac-address}

When you first launch the app, it will show a "Loading..." screen. On the right side, it will display your **"TV MAC Address"**. It will look something like `aa:bb:cc:11:22:33`.

**Write this MAC address down. You will need it.**

If you miss this screen, you can find the MAC address by going to the app's **Settings**.

## Step 3: Upload Your M3U Playlist {#step-3-upload-your-m3u-playlist}

This step is done on your **computer or phone**, not your TV.

When you sign up for an IPTV service, your provider will send you an **M3U Link** (e.g., `http://example.com/get.php?username=...`). Copy this link.

1.  Go to the SIPTV website: `siptv.app/mylist/`
2.  Find the section titled "Upload playlist File or external playlist URL with auto-update."
3.  In the **MAC** field, type the MAC address you wrote down from Step 2.
4.  In the **URL** (Link) field, paste your M3U Link.
5.  Click the **"Send"** (or "Upload") button.

## Step 4: Restart the App {#step-4-restart-the-app}

Go back to your LG TV. Exit the 'Smart IPTV' app completely (close it from the recent apps) and then re-open it. The app will now display "Loading channels..." and your playlist will appear.

## Alternative Apps {#alternative-apps}

Other apps like "IPTV Smarters Player" are also available on the LG Content Store. These apps may be easier to use, as they often support the "Xtream Codes" (Username/Password/URL) login method.

If this process seems too complex, don't worry. Our support team can walk you through it. Just visit our [Help Center](/help) with your M3U link and TV MAC address.
