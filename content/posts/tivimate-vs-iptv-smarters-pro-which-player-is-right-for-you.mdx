When you have an IPTV subscription, you need a "player" app to watch it. The two most popular and respected players on the market are **TiviMate** and **IPTV Smarters Pro**.

Both are excellent, but they are built for slightly different users. This comparison will help you choose.

## What Are They? (They Are Not Services) {#what-are-they-not-services}

This is the most important thing to know: **Neither TiviMate nor IPTV Smarters Pro provides any channels.** They are empty players. You *must* have an IPTV subscription to use them.

## User Interface (UI): The Modern Look vs. The Classic Feel {#user-interface-ui}

* **TiviMate:** This is TiviMate's biggest strength. Its interface is modern, clean, and designed to look and feel exactly like a premium cable box from a top-tier provider. The EPG (TV Guide) is beautiful and fast.
* **IPTV Smarters Pro:** The interface is more basic and functional. It's not as "pretty" as TiviMate, but it's very clear, easy to navigate, and reliable.

## Features and Customization {#features-and-customization}

* **TiviMate:** This is built for power users. You can customize channel groups, re-order channels, manage multiple playlists, and fine-tune your EPG settings.
* **IPTV Smarters Pro:** This is built for simplicity. It handles all the basics (Live TV, VOD, EPG) perfectly but doesn't offer the deep customization of TiviMate.

## Cost: Free vs. Premium {#cost-free-vs-premium}

* **TiviMate:** Has a limited free version. To unlock its best features (which is the whole reason to use it), you need to purchase **TiviMate Premium**. This is a small, one-time fee paid to the app developer.
* **IPTV Smarters Pro:** Is **100% free**. All its features are unlocked from the start.

## The Verdict: Which Player is Right for You? {#the-verdict}

* **You should choose IPTV Smarters Pro if:** You are a beginner, you want a "no-fuss" app that is completely free, and you just want to log in and watch TV with zero hassle.
* **You should choose TiviMate if:** You are a "power user," you appreciate a beautiful, modern EPG, and you are willing to pay the small one-time fee to have the best, most customizable experience.

Both are fully supported by our service. If you need help setting up either one, please visit our [Help Center](/help).
