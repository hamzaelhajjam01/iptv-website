faqs:
  - q: "Does IPTV really include all sports packages?"
    a: "Yes. A premium IPTV subscription typically includes all major national and international sports packages in one bundle, including NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and global soccer leagues."
  - q: "What is PPV and is it included?"
    a: "PPV stands for Pay-Per-View. These are the major UFC and boxing events that normally cost $80-$100 each. On a premium IPTV service, these events are included at no extra charge."
  - q: "Will sports streams be in 4K?"
    a: "Many major sporting events are broadcast in 4K and 1080p 60fps (frames-per-second) on IPTV. This 60fps stream is crucial as it provides a super-smooth picture for fast-moving action."
  - q: "What is a 'blackout' and how does IPTV bypass it?"
    a: "A blackout is when a local game is not shown in your area to protect the TV broadcaster. IPTV bypasses this by providing feeds from *other* cities or countries where the game is not blacked out."

Being a true sports fan in 2025 is expensive and confusing.
* Want to watch all the NFL games? You need NFL Sunday Ticket.
* Want to watch your out-of-market NBA team? You need NBA League Pass.
* Want to watch the big UFC fight? That's a separate $80 PPV.
* Want to watch the English Premier League? That's on yet another service.

Before you know it, you're paying $500+ per year for a fragmented mess. This is the problem that IPTV solves perfectly.

## The Sports Fan's Dilemma: Blackouts and Expensive Packages {#the-sports-fans-dilemma}

The traditional sports media model is broken. Rights are split across dozens of services, and local "blackouts" (where a game is not shown in your area) are frustrating. You are forced to buy multiple, expensive packages just to follow your favorite teams.

## The IPTV Solution: All Sports, One Subscription {#the-iptv-solution-all-sports}

A premium IPTV service bundles all these fragmented sports packages into one single, affordable subscription. Instead of 5 separate apps, you get one login with *all* the content.

### NFL Sunday Ticket & RedZone {#feature-nfl}

A premium IPTV subscription includes all out-of-market NFL games, just like Sunday Ticket, plus NFL RedZone. You never have to miss your favorite team's game again.

### NBA, NHL, & MLB League Passes {#feature-nba-nhl-mlb}

Want to watch any game, from any team, any night? IPTV plans include the full league pass packages for NBA, NHL, and MLB, giving you access to hundreds of games.

### Global Soccer (EPL, La Liga, etc.) {#feature-global-soccer}

IPTV services consolidate feeds from all over the world, giving you access to every English Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, and Champions League match.

### PPV Events (UFC & Boxing) {#feature-ppv}

This is one of the biggest value propositions. All major UFC and Boxing Pay-Per-View (PPV) events are included as part of the standard channel lineup, saving you $80-$100 per event.

## How IPTV Bypasses Blackouts {#how-iptv-bypasses-blackouts}

IPTV bypasses blackouts by providing you with channel feeds from *other* cities. For example, if the L.A. Lakers game is blacked out on your local ABC channel in Los Angeles, your IPTV service will also have the ABC feed from San Diego, where the game *is* airing. You just switch to that channel and watch the game.
