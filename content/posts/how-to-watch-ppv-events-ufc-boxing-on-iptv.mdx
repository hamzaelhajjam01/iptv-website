A major UFC or boxing event is coming up, but it's a Pay-Per-View (PPV). In the US, that means paying **$80 or more** for a single night of entertainment. This forces most fans to miss out on the biggest fights.

This is where IPTV provides the single greatest value for sports fans.

## The Problem: The Sky-High Cost of PPV {#the-problem-ppv-cost}

Services like ESPN+ and DAZN charge an enormous premium for major events. In addition to your monthly subscription, you have to pay an extra $80 fee just to unlock the main card. For fans who want to watch every event, this can add up to thousands of dollars per year.

## The IPTV Solution: PPV Included {#the-iptv-solution-ppv-included}

On a premium IPTV service, **PPV events are included as part of your regular subscription.**

There is no extra fee. You do not have to "order" the fight.

When a big UFC or boxing match is on, new "PPV" channels will appear in your guide. You simply tune to that channel and watch the entire event, from the prelims to the main card.

## How to Find the PPV Event on Your IPTV {#how-to-find-ppv}

On fight night, you can usually find the event in two places:

### 1. The 'PPV' or 'Events' Category {#find-ppv-category}

Most providers have a dedicated channel group labeled "PPV," "Live Events," or "Boxing/UFC." Inside, you will find multiple feeds for the event.

### 2. The Sports Channels (UK Feeds) {#find-sports-channels-uk}

In the UK, these same events are often broadcast on **TNT Sports** (formerly BT Sport). Your IPTV subscription includes these UK channels, so you can simply tune to the TNT Sports feed and watch the official broadcast there.

## A Note on Quality and Reliability {#quality-and-reliability}

Providers understand that thousands of users will be watching this one event. They offer multiple feeds in 4K, HD, and SD to ensure that if one stream has an issue, you can immediately switch to another.

By including all PPV events, an IPTV subscription can literally pay for itself in a single night. Check our [channels and features](/channels-features) to see what's included and our [pricing](/pricing) page to see the value.
