Watching PPV on IPTV has become the go-to solution for sports fans who are tired of paying **$80 or more** for a single UFC or boxing event. If you're looking for an affordable way to access major Pay-Per-View (PPV) fights, IPTV services include these premium events as part of your regular subscription.

This is where IPTV provides the single greatest value for combat sports fans.

## The Problem: The Sky-High Cost of PPV {#the-problem-ppv-cost}

Services like ESPN+ and DAZN charge an enormous premium for major events. In addition to your monthly subscription, you have to pay an extra $80 fee just to unlock the main card. For fans who want to watch every event, this can add up to thousands of dollars per year.

## The IPTV Solution: PPV Included {#the-iptv-solution-ppv-included}

On a premium IPTV service, **PPV events are included as part of your regular subscription.**

There is no extra fee. You do not have to "order" the fight.

When a big UFC or boxing match is on, new "PPV" channels will appear in your guide. You simply tune to that channel and watch the entire event, from the prelims to the main card.

## How to Find the PPV Event on Your IPTV {#how-to-find-ppv}

On fight night, you can usually find the event in two places:

### 1. The 'PPV' or 'Events' Category {#find-ppv-category}

Most providers have a dedicated channel group labeled "PPV," "Live Events," or "Boxing/UFC." Inside, you will find multiple feeds for the event.

### 2. The Sports Channels (UK Feeds) {#find-sports-channels-uk}

In the UK, these same events are often broadcast on **TNT Sports** (formerly BT Sport). Your IPTV subscription includes these UK channels, so you can simply tune to the TNT Sports feed and watch the official broadcast there.

## A Note on Quality and Reliability {#quality-and-reliability}

Providers understand that thousands of users will be watching this one event. They offer multiple feeds in 4K, HD, and SD to ensure that if one stream has an issue, you can immediately switch to another.

By including all PPV events, an IPTV subscription can literally pay for itself in a single night. Check our [channels and features](/channels-features) to see what's included and our [pricing](/pricing) page to see the value.

## Using IPTV Smarters for PPV Events {#using-iptv-smarters-ppv}

IPTV Smarters is one of the most popular IPTV player apps, and it's particularly well-suited for watching PPV on IPTV. Here's why sports fans prefer it:

**Easy Channel List Navigation**: IPTV Smarters organizes your channel list into categories, making it simple to navigate to the "PPV" or "Sports Events" section on fight night. You can quickly browse all available feeds for the event and select your preferred stream.

**High Quality Streams**: The app supports multiple stream formats and automatically adjusts quality based on your connection. This means you get high quality streams in 4K or HD without manual configuration. If one PPV feed is experiencing high traffic, you can instantly switch to another backup stream from the same channel list.

**Favorites and EPG**: You can add upcoming PPV channels to your favorites list and enable the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) to see exactly when prelims and main cards start. This makes it easy to plan your viewing and never miss a fight.

Whether you're on Android, iOS, or a Smart TV, IPTV Smarters provides a reliable, user-friendly way to enjoy PPV on IPTV with high quality streams and seamless channel list management.
