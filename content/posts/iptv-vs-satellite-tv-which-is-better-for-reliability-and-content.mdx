faqs:
  - q: "Does satellite TV have better picture quality than IPTV?"
    a: "Not anymore. In the past, satellite's dedicated broadcast was very high quality. Today, premium IPTV services offer 4K and 1080p 60fps streams that are as good or better than satellite, without the signal compression."
  - q: "Does IPTV work when it rains?"
    a: "Yes. IPTV is delivered over your wired (or 5G) internet connection, which is not affected by rain, snow, or wind. Satellite TV, which relies on a signal from the sky, is famous for cutting out during heavy storms."
  - q: "Is satellite TV cheaper than IPTV?"
    a: "No. Satellite TV is very similar to cable in cost. It often requires expensive hardware (the dish), a professional installation fee, and a long-term contract, making it much more expensive than IPTV."
  - q: "Does IPTV require a contract like satellite?"
    a: "No. Reputable IPTV services are prepaid and do not require contracts. You can pay monthly, quarterly, or yearly. See our [pricing](/pricing) plans for examples."

Like cable, satellite TV (from providers like DirecTV or Dish) was a dominant force for decades, especially in rural areas. But how does it stack up against modern IPTV in 2025?

This comparison breaks down the key differences in reliability, content, and cost.

## The Core Difference: Internet vs. Dish {#the-core-difference-internet-vs-dish}

* **Satellite TV:** A large dish on your roof captures a signal broadcast from a satellite in orbit. This signal is decoded by a receiver box connected to your TV.
* **IPTV:** Your existing internet connection streams video data to an app on your streaming device (like a Firestick or Smart TV). There is no dish and no special hardware required.

## Reliability: What Happens in Bad Weather? {#reliability-what-happens-in-bad-weather}

This is the most famous weakness of satellite TV.
* **Satellite TV:** The signal is vulnerable to "rain fade." Heavy rain, snow, or even dense clouds can block the signal from space, causing your picture to freeze, pixelate, or cut out entirely.
* **IPTV:** IPTV is delivered over your wired internet connection (or 5G/Wi-Fi). It is **not affected by weather**. As long as your internet is on, your TV works, rain or shine.

## Content & Channel Library {#content-channel-library}

* **Satellite TV:** Offers a good selection of 200-500 channels, but you are still limited by what the provider broadcasts to your specific region.
* **IPTV:** Offers a massive global selection. A premium plan includes 10,000+ live channels from all over the world, plus a VOD library of movies and series. IPTV provides a much larger volume of [channels and features](/channels-features) for a lower price.

## Cost and Contracts {#cost-and-contracts}

* **Satellite TV:** Requires professional installation of a physical dish, hardware rental fees for each receiver box, and a long-term (usually 2-year) contract with penalties for early termination.
* **IPTV:** Requires no installation and no contract. You can sign up online, get your login in minutes, and use your existing streaming devices. Our [pricing](/pricing) is prepaid, so you can stop at any time.

## The Verdict: Which is Right for You? {#the-verdict}

**IPTV is the clear winner for almost everyone.** It's more reliable in bad weather, requires no contract, has no installation fees, and offers 20-30x more content for a fraction of the price.

The only scenario where satellite TV wins is if you live in a very remote, rural area with no access to stable, high-speed internet (25 Mbps+). For everyone else, IPTV is the modern, more logical choice.
