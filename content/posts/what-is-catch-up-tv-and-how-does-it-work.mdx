faqs:
  - q: "How long does Catch-Up content stay available?"
    a: "This depends on the provider, but the most common durations are 3, 5, or 7 days. This allows you to 'catch up' on anything you missed during the week."
  - q: "Why don't all channels have the Catch-Up feature?"
    a: "Catch-Up requires your provider to dedicate massive server storage to record that channel 24/7. This is expensive, so it's typically reserved for the most popular sports, news, and entertainment channels."
  - q: "Can I fast-forward and rewind Catch-Up streams?"
    a: "Yes. Once you start a Catch-Up stream, your player treats it just like a video file. You can pause, rewind, and fast-forward through the program (and commercials)."

"Catch-Up" (also called "Replay") is one of the most valuable features of a modern IPTV service. It blends the immediate access of VOD with the timeliness of live TV, ensuring you never have to miss your favorite show again.

## Catch-Up: The 'Cloud DVR' You Don't Have to Set {#cloud-dvr}

In short, Catch-Up is a feature where your IPTV provider automatically records all the programming on specific channels—usually for 3 to 7 days.

This means if you forgot to record a show or missed the game, you don't need a physical DVR. You can simply open your EPG (Electronic Program Guide), scroll *back* in time to that program, and press play.

## How Does Catch-Up Technology Work? {#how-does-it-work}

Your IPTV provider runs a massive bank of servers that are constantly recording the live broadcast feeds of popular channels. When you select a past program, the server finds that recording and streams it to you, just as it would stream a VOD file.

## VOD vs. Catch-Up: What's the Difference? {#vod-vs-catch-up}

* **VOD (Video on Demand):** This is a static library of movies and TV series. It's like Netflix. The content is permanent and doesn't change daily.
* **Catch-Up:** This is tied directly to the live TV guide. It's a *rolling* archive of recently aired programs. A show that aired 10 days ago will likely be gone, while one that aired yesterday will be available.

## How to Find and Use Catch-Up Content {#how-to-find-catch-up}

In most IPTV players (like TiviMate or IPTV Smarters), you'll see a small "Replay" icon or "Clock" icon next to the channel name in the EPG. This icon is your signal that the channel has Catch-Up enabled.

You can then scroll back in the guide, select a program that has already aired, and an option to "Play Catch-Up" will appear.

This is a premium feature that is a key part of our service. You can see a full list of all our [channels and features](/channels-features) on our site.
