faqs:
  - q: "What's more important: channel count or stream stability?"
    a: "Stability, 100%. A service with 20,000 channels is useless if they all buffer. Look for providers that advertise 'Anti-Freeze' or 'Anti-Buffer' technology, as this signals a focus on server quality."
  - q: "What is 'Catch-Up TV'?"
    a: "Catch-Up is a premium feature that lets you 'rewind' the TV guide and watch shows that aired in the past (usually 3-7 days ago). It's like a cloud DVR that you don't have to set."
  - q: "What is a VOD library?"
    a: "VOD stands for 'Video on Demand.' This is a separate library of movies and TV series that you can watch anytime, just like Netflix. A good VOD library is a huge part of an IPTV subscription."

Choosing an IPTV service can be confusing. Every website promises "all the channels" for a low price. But the *quality* of a service isn't in the channel count; it's in the features and reliability.

Before you subscribe, make sure your provider checks these 10 essential boxes.

## 1. High-Quality, Stable Streams (4K & Anti-Freeze) {#feature-1-stable-streams}

This is the most important feature. A provider with 10,000 buffering channels is worthless. Look for services that specifically advertise **4K/HD quality** and **"Anti-Freeze" or "Anti-Buffer" technology**. This means they invest in high-speed, stable servers.

## 2. A Large Channel Library (Global Content) {#feature-2-channel-library}

A good service should offer thousands of live channels (10,000-20,000+) from all over the world, including the US, UK, Canada, and Europe. This should include all premium sports, movie, and entertainment packages.

## 3. A Full EPG (Electronic Program Guide) {#feature-3-epg}

An EPG is non-negotiable. This is the "TV Guide" that tells you what's on, what's coming up, and allows you to browse by channel. A service without a functional EPG is just a chaotic list of links.

## 4. A Massive VOD Library (Movies & Series) {#feature-4-vod-library}

VOD (Video on Demand) is the "Netflix" part of your subscription. A premium service will include a library of 20,000-100,000+ movies and full TV series that you can watch any time, with new releases added regularly.

## 5. 'Catch-Up' TV (Replay Feature) {#feature-5-catch-up-tv}

Catch-Up is a cloud-based DVR. It allows you to "rewind" the EPG (usually 3-7 days) and watch shows you missed. This is a must-have feature for anyone who can't always watch live.

## 6. Broad Device Compatibility (Firestick, Android, etc.) {#feature-6-device-compatibility}

Your provider should support all major devices, including Amazon Firestick, Android TV boxes, Smart TVs, PCs, and mobile phones. This ensures you can watch your subscription on the hardware you already own.

## 7. Xtream Codes Login (Easy Setup) {#feature-7-xtream-codes}

Look for a provider that gives you "Xtream Codes" credentials (Username, Password, Server URL). This is the easiest and most reliable way to log in to modern players like TiviMate and IPTV Smarters, as it automatically loads your channels and EPG.

## 8. Multi-Connection Options {#feature-8-multi-connection}

A standard plan usually includes one connection. A good provider will offer the option to add **2-5 connections** (for a small fee) so you can watch in the living room, on your phone, and in the bedroom all at the same time.

## 9. 24/7 Customer Support {#feature-9-customer-support}

This is critical. When your service has a problem, you need help *now*. Look for providers that offer 24/7 customer support via live chat, email, or a ticketing system.

## 10. Free Trial or Test Account {#feature-10-free-trial}

A confident provider will let you test their service. Look for a **24-48 hour free trial** or a very cheap 1-day pass. This lets you test their stream stability and content *before* you commit to a full subscription.
