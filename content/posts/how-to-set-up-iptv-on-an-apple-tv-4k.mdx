The Apple TV 4K, with its powerful chip and smooth tvOS interface, is a high-end device perfect for streaming. While it's famous for apps like Netflix and Apple TV+, it's also one of the best devices for watching a premium IPTV service.

This guide will show you how to set up your IPTV subscription on your Apple TV, allowing you to integrate thousands of channels into your high-end entertainment system.

## Can You Watch IPTV on an Apple TV? {#can-you-watch-iptv-on-apple-tv}

Yes! Unlike some systems that require "sideloading," the Apple TV App Store has several high-quality, legitimate IPTV players. You simply download one of these player apps and log in with the credentials provided by your IPTV service.

These apps act as a powerful "player" for your subscription, giving you a clean interface and a full EPG (Electronic Program Guide).

## M3U vs. Xtream Codes: The Easiest Login Method {#m3u-vs-xtream-codes}

When you get your IPTV subscription, you will be given login details. The two most common types are "M3U Link" and "Xtream Codes API."

* **M3U Link:** This is a long web address that you paste into the app. You often need to add a separate link for the EPG (TV Guide).
* **Xtream Codes API:** This is the easiest method. You just need to enter three things: a **Username**, a **Password**, and a **Server URL**. The app then logs in and automatically downloads all your channels and EPG data.

**We strongly recommend using the "Xtream Codes" login** whenever possible.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Using 'Smarters Player Lite' {#step-by-step-smarters-player-lite}

"Smarters Player Lite" is a free and popular app available directly on the tvOS App Store. It's a great place to start.

### Step 1: Download the App {#step-1-download-the-app}

1.  On your Apple TV, go to the **App Store**.
2.  Search for **"Smarters Player Lite"**.
3.  Select the app and download it.

### Step 2: Open the App and Add User {#step-2-open-app-and-add-user}

Open the Smarters Player app. It will ask you to accept its terms. After that, you'll see a screen to "Add User." Select **"Login with Xtream Codes API"**.

### Step 3: Log in with Xtream Codes {#step-3-log-in-with-xtream-codes}

The app will show you four fields. Enter the credentials from your IPTV welcome email:
1.  **Any Name:** This is just a label. You can type "My TV" or your provider's name.
2.  **Username:** (Enter your provider's username)
3.  **Password:** (Enter your provider's password)
4.  **Server URL:** (Enter the server URL, e.g., `http://example.com:1234`)

Click **"Add User"**. The app will verify your details and start downloading your channels and EPG.

## Alternative App: IPTVX {#alternative-app-iptvx}

If you want a more stylish interface, another top-tier app is **IPTVX**. The setup is almost identical:
1.  Download **IPTVX** from the App Store.
2.  Open the app and choose to add a new playlist.
3.  Select **"Login with Xtream Codes"**.
4.  Enter your same three credentials (Username, Password, Server URL).

## Explore Your New Channels {#explore-your-new-channels}

That's it! Your Apple TV is now set up. You can browse your full channel list, check the EPG for what's on, and explore the massive VOD (Video on Demand) library. To see what kind of content you can expect, check out our full list of [channels and features](/channels-features).
