faqs:
  - q: "What is an NBA blackout?"
    a: "An NBA blackout is when NBA League Pass blocks you from watching your local team's game live. This is to protect the exclusive broadcast rights of your local TV channel (like a regional sports network)."
  - q: "How does IPTV bypass NBA blackouts?"
    a: "IPTV bypasses blackouts by giving you access to *all* the local regional sports networks (RSNs). If you're in Boston, you can't watch the Celtics on League Pass. But with IPTV, you can just watch the official 'NBC Sports Boston' channel feed."
  - q: "Can I watch NBA Playoffs and Finals on IPTV?"
    a: "Yes. All NBA Playoff and Finals games are broadcast on national channels like ESPN, ABC, and TNT. All these channels are included in a standard premium IPTV package."
  - q: "Can I watch on multiple devices?"
    a: "NBA League Pass Premium allows streaming on three devices at once. A standard IPTV plan is for one device, but you can add connections to watch on multiple TVs simultaneously."

For NBA fans, **NBA League Pass** seems like the perfect solution—every game, all season long. But there's a frustrating catch: **blackouts**. If you live in or near your favorite team's city, you are blacked out from watching their games on League Pass.

This is the problem IPTV was built to solve.

## The Problem: NBA League Pass Blackouts {#the-problem-nba-blackouts}

NBA League Pass is an "out-of-market" package. It's designed for fans who live in a different state. If you live in Los Angeles, you cannot watch the Lakers or Clippers on League Pass. You are *required* to watch them on your local Regional Sports Network (RSN), which often requires an expensive cable subscription.

National games on ESPN, ABC, or TNT are also blacked out on League Pass.

## The IPTV Solution: The 'Ultimate' League Pass {#the-iptv-solution}

A premium IPTV subscription is the "ultimate" NBA League Pass because it gives you *both* the League Pass feeds *and* all the local RSNs, all in one place.

### 1. Access to All Regional Sports Networks (RSNs) {#feature-all-rsns}

An IPTV service includes the local RSNs from every market. This means you get:
* YES Network (Brooklyn Nets)
* NBC Sports Boston (Boston Celtics)
* Bally Sports (dozens of teams)
* ...and every other regional broadcaster.

### 2. Home & Away Feeds {#feature-home-and-away}

Just like League Pass, IPTV services typically provide both the "Home" and "Away" broadcast feeds for each game. This lets you choose which commentary team you want to listen to.

### 3. All National Games (ESPN, TNT) & NBA TV {#feature-national-games}

All the national channels (ESPN, ABC, TNT) and the NBA TV 24/7 network are included as standard. You no longer have to worry about a game being blacked out because it's on national TV.

## How This Beats Blackouts {#how-this-beats-blackouts}

It's simple. If you live in New York and the Knicks game is blacked out on your League Pass feed, you just go to your IPTV channel list, scroll to the "MSG Network" (the local RSN), and watch the official broadcast just like a local cable subscriber.

With IPTV, you have access to *every* feed, so you are *never* blacked out.
