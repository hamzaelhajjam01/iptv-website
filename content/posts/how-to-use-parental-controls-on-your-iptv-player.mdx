faqs:
  - q: "Do parental controls lock all content?"
    a: "No, you can be selective. Most apps allow you to lock specific channel categories (like 'Adult') or set a rating limit (e.g., lock all content rated 'MA')."
  - q: "What if I forget my parental control PIN?"
    a: "If you forget your PIN, you will usually have to log out of the app and log back in by re-entering your Xtream Codes. This will reset the app and remove the PIN."
  - q: "Are the parental controls part of my IPTV subscription?"
    a: "No, this is a feature of the *player app* (like TiviMate or Smarters), not the subscription. Your provider does not set or see your PIN."

An IPTV service gives you access to thousands of channels from around the world, which is fantastic. However, this often includes adult-rated content or other channels you may not want your children to access.

Fortunately, the most popular IPTV player apps have excellent built-in parental controls. This guide shows you how to set them up.

## How IPTV Parental Controls Work {#how-parental-controls-work}

Parental controls are a feature of your **player app**, not your IPTV service. You set a 4-digit PIN inside the app's settings. This allows you to "lock" specific channel categories (like "Adult" or "VOD - Horror") or even the app's settings menu itself.

## How to Set Up Controls in TiviMate {#how-to-tivimate}

TiviMate has very robust and easy-to-use parental controls.
1.  From the TiviMate home screen, go to **Settings**.
2.  Select **Parental Controls**.
3.  Choose **"Change PIN"** and set a 4-digit PIN.
4.  You can now lock specific features:
    * **Lock Groups:** This is the best option. You can hide and lock the entire "Adult" or "VOD" category.
    * **Lock Settings:** This prevents kids from changing your app settings.
    * **Lock Playlists:** This locks your entire subscription.
5.  Now, when anyone tries to access a locked group, they will be required to enter the PIN.

## How to Set Up Controls in IPTV Smarters Pro {#how-to-iptv-smarters}

IPTV Smarters also has a simple built-in feature.
1.  From the app's main dashboard, click on the **Settings** icon (gear).
2.  Select **"Parental Control"**.
3.  Enter a 4-digit PIN and click **"Save"**.
4.  You can then go back to the settings and choose which categories (like "Live TV," "Movies," or "Series") you want to lock with this PIN.
