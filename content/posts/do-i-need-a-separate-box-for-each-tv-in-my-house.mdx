faqs:
  - q: "Can I just move my Firestick from one TV to another?"
    a: "Yes, absolutely. Your subscription is tied to the login, not the device or TV. You can move your Firestick between TVs, or take it to a hotel, and it will work perfectly."
  - q: "Do I need two separate subscriptions for two TVs?"
    a: "No. You don't need two subscriptions. You just need *one* subscription with a 'multi-connection' or 'multi-room' plan. This allows your single account to watch on multiple devices at once."
  - q: "What does a '2 Connection' plan mean?"
    a: "A '2 Connection' plan means your account can be actively streaming on two devices at the same time. This is perfect for a couple or a small family. You can check our [pricing](/pricing) page for multi-connection options."
  - q: "What happens if I use too many connections?"
    a: "If you have a 1-connection plan and try to log in on a second device, the first device will usually be kicked off, or both streams will buffer and fail. Your provider may also lock your account temporarily."

This is a very common question. You have a TV in the living room, the bedroom, and the basement. Do you need to buy three separate subscriptions?

The short answer: **You need one streaming device for each TV, but you only need one *subscription* with a "multi-connection" plan.**

## The 'One Box, One TV' Rule {#one-box-one-tv}

An IPTV subscription doesn't magically appear on your TV. It needs to be loaded into a player app, which runs on a streaming device (like a Firestick, Apple TV, or Android Box).

Each TV needs its *own* streaming device to "tune in" to the service. You cannot stream to two TVs from one Firestick.

## What is a 'Connection'? {#what-is-a-connection}

A standard IPTV plan comes with **one connection**. This means you can be actively streaming on **one device at a time**.

You can install your login details on ten different devices, but you can only *watch* on one at a time. If you start streaming on your Firestick and then someone else starts watching on your smartphone, the Firestick stream will be "kicked off" or will stop working.

## How to Watch on Multiple TVs (The 'Multi-Connection' Plan) {#how-to-watch-on-multiple-tvs}

The solution is a "multi-connection" (or "multi-room") plan.

When you sign up, you can choose how many connections you need. A "2-connection" plan lets you watch on two devices at once. A "4-connection" plan lets you watch on four devices at once.

This is the perfect, cost-effective solution for a household. You pay a small extra fee to add more connections to your *single account*, which is much cheaper than buying multiple, separate subscriptions. You can see the options on our [pricing](/pricing) page.

## What Happens If I Use Too Many Connections? {#what-happens-if-i-use-too-many}

If you have a 1-connection plan and try to log in on a second device, the server will refuse the connection. The most common result is that the first stream stops, and both devices get a connection error or buffering. Some providers may also temporarily lock your account for security.
