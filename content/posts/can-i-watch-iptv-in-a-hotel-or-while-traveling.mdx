faqs:
  - q: "What is a 'captive portal'?"
    a: "A captive portal is the login page that pops up on hotel, airport, or coffee shop Wi-Fi where you must enter a room number or agree to terms. Streaming devices like Firesticks cannot see these pages."
  - q: "Will my IPTV service work in another country?"
    a: "Yes. Because the service is delivered over the internet, it works globally. However, some countries may be 'geo-blocked' by the provider. Using a VPN set to your home country bypasses this."
  - q: "Will I get 'locked out' of my account if I travel?"
    a: "No. Your account is tied to your login, not your location. As long as you are only using the one-connection plan on one device at a time, you will not be locked out."

One of the greatest benefits of IPTV is its portability. Unlike cable or satellite, your subscription is not tied to your house. You can take your Firestick or laptop with you and watch your channels from anywhere in the world.

However, there is one common problem travelers face: hotel Wi-Fi.

## Yes! IPTV is Made for Travel {#yes-iptv-is-made-for-travel}

Your IPTV subscription is delivered over the internet. As long as your streaming device (Firestick, Android Box, or laptop) has a stable internet connection, it will work exactly as it does at home. You can watch your local news from your home country while on vacation or catch the big game from your hotel room.

## The Big Challenge: Hotel Wi-Fi (Captive Portals) {#the-challenge-hotel-wifi}

The biggest problem with traveling is "captive portals." This is the web page that pops up when you first connect to a hotel or airport Wi-Fi, asking you to enter your room number or agree to the terms of service.

Streaming devices like a Firestick or Android Box do not have a built-in web browser, so they **cannot see this login page**. They will just report "No Internet," leaving you stuck.

## How to Bypass a 'Captive Portal' {#how-to-bypass-captive-portal}

You have two easy solutions to this problem.

### Solution 1: Use Your Phone's Mobile Hotspot (Easiest) {#solution-1-mobile-hotspot}

This is the simplest fix.
1.  Enable the **"Mobile Hotspot"** or "Tethering" feature on your smartphone.
2.  Connect your Firestick or streaming device to *your phone's Wi-Fi hotspot*, not the hotel Wi-Fi.
3.  Your phone will use its mobile data to power the stream.
4.  (Optional) Once connected, you can use a VPN on your streaming device to encrypt the traffic.

### Solution 2: Use a Portable Travel Router (Advanced) {#solution-2-travel-router}

A portable "travel router" is a small device that creates its own private Wi-Fi network.
1.  You connect the travel router to the hotel's Wi-Fi (using your phone or laptop to log in through its captive portal *once*).
2.  Then, you connect your Firestick, phone, and laptop to *your travel router's* Wi-Fi network.
3.  The router manages the connection for all your devices.

## A Note on Geo-Restrictions {#note-on-geo-restrictions}

Some channels may be "geo-locked" and only work in certain countries. The easiest way to bypass this is to use a VPN on your streaming device. Simply connect your VPN to a server in your home country, and all your channels will work as normal.
