faqs:
  - q: "What is the standard number of connections?"
    a: "The industry standard for a basic IPTV plan is one (1) connection. You can almost always add more connections for an additional fee."
  - q: "Can I upgrade my plan to add connections later?"
    a: "Yes. Most providers, including us, allow you to upgrade your plan at any time. You can start with one connection and add more later as your family needs grow."
  - q: "Will my account be banned if my whole family is watching?"
    a: "Not if you have the right plan! If you have a '4-connection' plan, you can have four people watching on four different devices at the same time without any issues."
  - q: "Do I need to be in the same house for multi-connection?"
    a: "This depends on the provider. Some providers restrict multi-connections to the same IP address (one household). Others are more flexible and allow you to use your connections in different locations."

When you browse IPTV [pricing](/pricing) plans, you'll always see the term "connection." This is the single most important part of your subscription, as it determines how many people can use the service at the same time.

This quick guide explains what a "multi-connection" plan is and who needs one.

## IPTV Connections Explained: One Stream at a Time {#connections-explained}

A "connection" (or "stream") is one active link from your account to the IPTV server.

A standard, basic IPTV plan almost always includes **one connection**.

This means you can be logged in on multiple devices (your Firestick, your phone, your laptop), but you can only **watch on one** of those devices at any given moment. If you start a stream on your phone while it's already playing on your TV, the TV stream will stop.

## Who Needs a Multi-Connection Plan? {#who-needs-multi-connection}

A multi-connection plan is for anyone who needs to watch TV on more than one device *at the same time*. This is ideal for:

* **Families:** One person can watch sports in the living room while someone else watches a movie in the bedroom.
* **Housemates:** You can split a single, high-quality subscription among roommates.
* **Power Users:** You might want to watch the game on your main TV while also keeping an eye on the news on your tablet.

## How to Choose the Right Plan {#how-to-choose-the-right-plan}

It's simple: choose the number of *simultaneous streams* your household needs.
* **1 Connection:** For a single person or a couple who only watches on one TV.
* **2-3 Connections:** Perfect for a small family or couple with different tastes.
* **4-5 Connections:** Ideal for a larger family or a shared household.

You can check our [pricing](/pricing) page to see the options for adding more connections. It's much cheaper to add connections to one account than to buy multiple separate subscriptions.

## The Risk of Using Too Many Connections {#risk-of-too-many-connections}

If you have a 1-connection plan and you try to "share" it with a friend or run it on two TVs at once, the provider's system will detect it. This will cause your streams to freeze, buffer, or get "kicked off." It can also lead to your account being temporarily locked or even permanently banned for abuse.

Always choose the plan that matches the number of simultaneous streams you actually need.
