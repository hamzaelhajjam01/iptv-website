If you're new to IPTV, you'll see the term "EPG" everywhere. An EPG is a simple feature that makes a *huge* difference in your viewing experience, turning a chaotic list of thousands of channels into a familiar, user-friendly TV guide.

This guide explains what an EPG is, how it works, and what features to look for.

## What is an EPG? {#what-is-an-epg}

EPG stands for **Electronic Program Guide**.

In simple terms, it's the on-screen menu that shows you a schedule of what's currently on and what's coming up next on each channel. If you've ever used a traditional cable or satellite box, you've used an EPG. It's the "Guide" button on your remote.

## How Does an EPG Work for IPTV? {#how-does-epg-work}

For IPTV, an EPG is a separate data stream. Your provider gives you two things: one link for the channels (your M3U link) and a second link for the guide data (your EPG link, often an XMLTV file).

Your IPTV player app (like TiviMate or IPTV Smarters) downloads the data from this EPG link and matches it to the channels you're receiving. This is how it knows that "Channel 101" is "HBO" and that "Game of Thrones" is on at 9:00 PM.

Services that use an "Xtream Codes" login handle this automatically, which is why it's the preferred method.

## The Key Features of a Modern EPG {#key-features-of-epg}

A good EPG is the difference between a high-end experience and a confusing mess.

### See What's On Now & Next {#feature-now-and-next}

The most basic function. You can scroll through your channels and see a one-line description of the current show and the next one.

### Browse by Category {#feature-browse-category}

A well-organized EPG, like the one included with our service, groups channels into categories like "Sports," "News," "Movies," and "Kids." This lets you browse by genre instead of scrolling through thousands of channels.

### Program Descriptions & Details {#feature-program-details}

Clicking on a show in the guide will bring up detailed information, such as a plot summary, actors, and the original air date.

## Why an EPG is Essential {#why-epg-is-essential}

Without an EPG, your IPTV service is just a massive, unordered list of channels. You have no idea what's on, what's coming up, or even what channel you're watching.

An EPG is the "brain" of your service that makes it usable. It allows you to navigate the vast number of [channels and features](/channels-features) available in your subscription, find your favorite shows, and discover new content.
