faqs:
  - q: "Which is more secure, M3U or Xtream Codes?"
    a: "Xtream Codes is generally considered more secure, as your username and password are not visible in a long URL. An M3U link often contains your login details right in the text."
  - q: "Do I need an EPG link if I use Xtream Codes?"
    a: "No. This is the biggest advantage of Xtream Codes. It automatically loads your channel list, VOD library, and EPG (TV Guide) all in one go. M3U links often require a separate EPG link."
  - q: "Can I convert my Xtream Codes to an M3U link?"
    a: "Yes. Your provider can generate an M3U link for you from your Xtream Codes account. This is necessary for apps like VLC Player or the Smart IPTV (SIPTV) app, which don't support Xtream Codes."
  - q: "Why does my M3U link not work?"
    a: "It's either a typo or your provider has reset your link. M3U links can sometimes be reset for security. If it stops working, you must get a new one from your provider's [Help Center](/help)."

When you get your IPTV subscription, you'll be presented with a few ways to log in. The two most common are an "M3U Link" and "Xtream Codes."

While both work, one is far easier and more powerful. This guide explains the difference.

## What is an M3U Link? {#what-is-an-m3u-link}

An **M3U Link** (or M3U URL) is a single, very long web address. This link is a plain text file that contains the names and server addresses of all the channels in your subscription.

You must copy this entire link and paste it into your player app (like VLC or the Smart IPTV app). You often need to paste a *second* link for your EPG (TV Guide) as well.

## What are 'Xtream Codes'? {#what-are-xtream-codes}

**Xtream Codes** is not an app; it's a **login method**. It's the modern, simple way to log in. Your provider just gives you three simple pieces of information:

1.  **Server URL:** (e.g., `http://example.com:1234`)
2.  **Username:** (e.g., `user123`)
3.  **Password:** (e.g., `pass123`)

You enter these three details into your player (like TiviMate or IPTV Smarters), and the app does the rest.

## The Main Differences: A Quick Comparison {#the-main-differences}

| Feature | M3U Link | Xtream Codes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Login Method** | Copy/Paste one long URL | Enter 3 short details |
| **EPG (TV Guide)** | Requires a *separate* EPG link | Loads EPG automatically |
| **VOD Library** | Loads VOD as one giant channel list | Loads VOD into a clean, separate "Movies" section |
| **Supported Apps** | All apps (VLC, Smart IPTV) | Most modern apps (TiviMate, Smarters) |

## Why We Recommend Xtream Codes {#why-we-recommend-xtream-codes}

**We recommend using Xtream Codes whenever possible.**

It is significantly easier to set up. You don't have to copy and paste long, complex URLs, and you never have to worry about finding or updating your EPG link. It automatically loads your channels, EPG, and VOD library all in one simple, clean login.

Some apps (like 'Smart IPTV' for Samsung TVs or VLC) do not support Xtream Codes, and for those, you *must* use the M3U link. For all others, Xtream Codes is the superior choice. If you're confused, our [Help Center](/help) can tell you which method is best for your device.
