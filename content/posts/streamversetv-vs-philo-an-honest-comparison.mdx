faqs:
  - q: "Does Philo have sports channels?"
    a: "No. Philo's main strategy is to be ultra-cheap, and they achieve this by having zero sports channels (like ESPN or Fox Sports) and very few local channels."
  - q: "Does Philo have local channels?"
    a: "No. Philo does not offer your local ABC, CBS, NBC, or Fox affiliates. It is a 'lifestyle and entertainment' package."
  - q: "Can I use Philo and StreamverseTV at the same time?"
    a: "Yes. In fact, some users pair Philo (for its reliable US entertainment channels) with an IPTV service to fill the gap in sports, news, and international content."
  - q: "Which service has better 4K quality?"
    a: "StreamverseTV offers thousands of channels in 4K and 1080p 60fps. Philo's content is typically limited to 720p or 1080p, with no 4K options available."
