A common term you'll see in any IPTV package is "VOD." This is a critical feature that provides a huge amount of value and is often just as important as the live channels themselves.

This guide explains what VOD is and how it's different from your standard Live TV.

## VOD: Your Personal Media Library {#vod-personal-media-library}

VOD stands for **Video On Demand**.

Think of it as your own private Netflix, built directly into your IPTV service. It is a massive, server-side library of thousands of movies and full TV series that you can browse and watch at any time.

## Live TV vs. VOD: The Key Differences {#live-tv-vs-vod}

* **Live TV:** This is a "stream." You are watching a scheduled broadcast in real-time. If you tune in at 8:05 PM, you've missed the first 5 minutes of the show.
* **VOD:** This is a "file." You select a movie or show from a library, and it always starts from the beginning. You can pause, fast-forward, and rewind it, just like a DVD or Netflix stream.

## How VOD is Organized in Your IPTV Service {#how-vod-is-organized}

In a good IPTV player (like IPTV Smarters or TiviMate), your VOD library will be in its own separate section, completely apart from "Live TV." It is typically organized into two main categories:
1.  **Movies:** Often sorted by genre (Action, Comedy, 4K), new releases, etc.
2.  **TV Series:** Organized by show, with all seasons and episodes neatly arranged.

## The Benefits of an Integrated VOD Library {#benefits-of-vod-library}

A large VOD library is a huge part of the value. Instead of paying for a cable package *and* multiple streaming services, a good IPTV subscription bundles them all together.

A premium service will have a VOD library with 50,000-100,000+ titles. You can see a full list of our VOD capabilities and all the [channels and features](/channels-features) that come with our service.
