faqs:
  - q: "What do I need to record IPTV?"
    a: "You need two things: 1) A player app that supports DVR, like TiviMate Premium. 2) A storage location, such as a USB flash drive plugged into your device, or a network-shared folder (SMB)."
  - q: "Does my IPTV provider offer cloud DVR?"
    a: "This is rare. Most IPTV providers do not offer cloud DVR. The recording is handled by your *player app* and saved to *your* storage, not on the provider's server. The 'Catch-Up' feature is the closest thing to a cloud DVR."
  - q: "How much storage do I need for recording?"
    a: "A one-hour HD stream can be 1-2 GB in size. A 64 GB or 128 GB USB 3.0 flash drive is a great, affordable option and can hold many hours of recordings."
  - q: "Can I record one show while watching another?"
    a: "This depends on your subscription. If you have a '1-connection' plan, you can only watch or record one stream at a time. To record one show while watching another, you would need a '2-connection' plan."

While most IPTV services offer a "Catch-Up" feature for shows that have already aired, you may still want to record a live program to keep permanently.

This is called **DVR** (Digital Video Recording), and it's a feature built into many premium player apps like TiviMate. Here’s how to set it up.

## DVR vs. Catch-Up: What's the Difference? {#dvr-vs-catch-up}

* **Catch-Up:** Is a "cloud" feature from your provider. It saves shows for a limited time (e.g., 3-7 days). You cannot keep these recordings.
* **DVR:** Is a "local" feature on your *app*. You are saving the stream directly to your own storage (like a USB drive). The recording is yours to keep forever.

## What You Need to Start Recording (Hardware) {#what-you-need-hardware}

You cannot record directly onto your Firestick's or Android Box's internal storage—it's too small. You need an external storage location. The two most common are:

1.  **A USB Flash Drive:** This is the easiest method. Get a 64 GB or 128 GB USB 3.0 flash drive and plug it into the USB port on your Android TV box or (with an OTG cable) your Firestick.
2.  **A Network (SMB) Drive:** For advanced users, you can set up a "shared" folder on your Windows PC or a NAS drive and have TiviMate save the recordings over your home network.

## How to Set Up Recording in TiviMate {#how-to-set-up-tivimate}

This guide focuses on TiviMate, as it has the best DVR function.

### Step 1: Format and Connect Your USB Drive {#step-1-format-usb}

Plug your USB drive into your streaming device. Your device (e.g., Nvidia Shield, Firestick) will ask to format it. Format it as **"External Storage"** (not "Internal/Adopted Storage").

### Step 2: Set the Recordings Folder in TiviMate {#step-2-set-recordings-folder}

1.  Open TiviMate and go to **Settings**.
2.  Go to **Recording** (this is a TiviMate Premium feature).
3.  Select **"Recordings folder"**.
4.  A file browser will open. Navigate to your USB drive, select it, and confirm.

TiviMate now knows where to save the files.

### Step 3: How to Record {#step-3-how-to-record}

You can now record in two ways:
* **Instant Record:** While watching a live channel, press and hold the "OK" or "Select" button on your remote. A menu will appear. Select "Record."
* **Schedule Record:** Go to the EPG (TV Guide). Find a future program, select it, and choose "Record." The app will automatically record that program when it airs, even if your TV is off.

## A Note on Connections {#a-note-on-connections}

Recording a show uses **one of your IPTV connections**. If you have a standard "1-connection" plan, you cannot record a show while watching another one. You would need a 2-connection plan to do this.
