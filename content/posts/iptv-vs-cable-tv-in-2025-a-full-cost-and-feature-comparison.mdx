faqs:
  - q: "Is IPTV really cheaper than cable TV?"
    a: "Yes, significantly. A premium IPTV subscription often costs for a full year what most cable packages cost for one or two months, while offering thousands more channels."
  - q: "Is IPTV legal?"
    a: "This depends on the provider. IPTV technology itself is legal. You must get your subscription from a provider that respects copyright and has the correct licensing."
  - q: "What are the main disadvantages of IPTV?"
    a: "The main disadvantage is its 100% dependency on your internet connection. If your internet goes down, your TV goes down. Cable TV is a separate connection and is not affected by internet outages."
  - q: "Can I get my local news and sports channels on IPTV?"
    a: "Yes, most premium IPTV services include all major US, UK, and Canadian local channels, as well as national sports networks. You can check our full [channels and features](/channels-features) list."

For decades, cable TV was the undisputed king of home entertainment. Today, its dominance is being challenged by a more flexible, affordable, and content-rich alternative: IPTV (Internet Protocol Television).

If you're tired of your rising cable bill, this comparison will break down the real differences in cost, content, and features.

## What is IPTV vs. Cable TV? {#what-is-iptv-vs-cable-tv}

* **Cable TV:** Delivers video signals to your home through a physical coaxial cable. The number of channels is fixed, and your service is tied to that one cable box.
* **IPTV:** Delivers video signals over your existing internet connection. It's a "smart" system that streams content to an app on your device (like a Firestick or Smart TV), giving you access to thousands of channels from around the globe.

## Cost Comparison: The Price Breakdown {#cost-comparison}

This is the most significant difference.

* **Cable TV:** Averages $80 - $150 per month, often with a 1- or 2-year contract. This price frequently includes hardware rental fees, broadcast fees, and regional sports fees, adding $20-$30+ in hidden charges to your bill.
* **IPTV:** A premium subscription typically costs a fraction of that for a *full year*. Our [pricing](/pricing) is transparent and all-inclusive, with no hidden fees, contracts, or hardware rentals.

## Feature Comparison: Content & Channels {#feature-comparison-content-channels}

* **Cable TV:** You get a fixed package of 100-400 channels, most of which you'll never watch. Your selection is limited to your specific country.
* **IPTV:** You get *everything*. A typical premium plan includes 10,000+ live channels from all over the world (USA, UK, Canada, Europe, Asia), plus a massive VOD (Video on Demand) library of movies and TV shows. This often includes all premium sports packages (NFL, NBA, PPV) at no extra cost. See our full [channels and features](/channels-features) list for an example.

### Portability and Device Support {#portability-and-device-support}

* **Cable TV:** You can only watch on the TV that has the cable box plugged into it.
* **IPTV:** You can watch on any device, anywhere in the world. You can install the app on your Firestick, Android Box, computer, or even your smartphone.

## Reliability and Performance {#reliability-and-performance}

* **Cable TV:** Extremely reliable. It's a "dumb" signal that works unless the cable is physically cut.
* **IPTV:** Entirely dependent on your internet. If your internet is slow or unstable, you will experience buffering. However, with a good internet connection (25 Mbps+), a premium IPTV service is just as stable as cable.

## The Verdict: Who Wins in 2025? {#the-verdict-who-wins}

For the vast majority of users, **IPTV is the clear winner**.

It offers thousands more channels, VOD content, and premium sports for a fraction of the price of cable. As long as you have a stable internet connection, IPTV provides vastly superior value and flexibility. Want to see the exact cost savings? Compare our transparent [pricing](/pricing) to your current cable bill and see the difference for yourself.
