faqs:
  - q: "What is an RSN?"
    a: "An RSN is a 'Regional Sports Network.' It's a cable channel that has the exclusive rights to broadcast the local games of a specific pro team (like the Yankees on YES, or the Red Sox on NESN)."
  - q: "Why is my local team blacked out on NBA League Pass or NHL Center Ice?"
    a: "Those 'league pass' packages are only for *out-of-market* games. They are not allowed to show you your local team's game because the RSN in your area owns the exclusive rights. This is a blackout."
  - q: "How does IPTV bypass these blackouts?"
    a: "IPTV bypasses blackouts by giving you access to *all* the RSNs from *all* cities. If you're a Lakers fan in Los Angeles, you're blacked out on League Pass, but with IPTV, you just watch the official 'Spectrum SportsNet' channel feed."

If you're a sports fan, you've experienced this frustration. You buy NBA League Pass to watch your favorite team, only to find their game is **blacked out** in your area. This is because of Regional Sports Networks (RSNs).

For sports fans, the ability to access every RSN is the single biggest reason to switch to IPTV.

## What is a Regional Sports Network (RSN)? {#what-is-an-rsn}

An RSN is a cable channel that has the exclusive local broadcast rights for a specific professional team.
* In New York, the **YES Network** has the rights to the Yankees.
* In New England, **NESN** has the rights to the Red Sox.
* In many cities, **Bally Sports** or **NBC Sports** has the rights to the local NBA, NHL, or MLB team.

These channels are typically only available in the most expensive cable packages.

## The Problem: Blackouts on 'League Pass' Packages {#the-problem-blackouts}

Services like NBA League Pass or NHL Center Ice are "out-of-market" packages. They are *not* allowed to show you your local team's games. They are blacked out, forcing you to buy a cable subscription to get that one RSN.

## The IPTV Solution: Every RSN, No Blackouts {#the-iptv-solution-every-rsn}

This is where IPTV shines. A premium IPTV service includes the channel feeds for **all RSNs from every market** in the country.

This means:
* You are **never blacked out**. If you're a Lakers fan in Los Angeles, you don't need NBA League Pass; you just watch the "Spectrum SportsNet" channel in your IPTV list.
* You can **watch any team**. If you're a Bulls fan living in Florida, you can just go to the "NBC Sports Chicago" channel feed and watch the official home broadcast.

## How to Find Your RSN on IPTV {#how-to-find-your-rsn}

In your IPTV channel guide, look for a category named "USA Sports," "Regional Sports," or "NFL/NBA/NHL." Inside, you will find a full list of all the RSNs from every city, allowing you to watch any game, for any team, at any time.

Our service includes a comprehensive RSN package. You can see the full list on our [channels and features](/channels-features) page.
