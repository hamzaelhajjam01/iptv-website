A major fear for people "cutting the cord" is losing their local channels. How will you watch the 6 o'clock news, see the weather report, or watch big events broadcast on national affiliates like ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC?

With a premium IPTV service, you don't lose these. In fact, you often get *more* local channels than you did with cable.

## Can You Get Local Channels on IPTV? {#can-you-get-local-channels-on-iptv}

Yes. High-quality IPTV services subscribe to and re-stream the local affiliate channels from all major (and many minor) markets across the USA, Canada, and the UK.

This means you can get:
* **Local News & Weather:** Watch your 6 PM local news and weather forecasts.
* **National Broadcasts:** Get all primetime shows and major sporting events (like the Super Bowl) that air on national networks.

## How IPTV Provides Local Channels {#how-iptv-provides-local-channels}

Your IPTV provider captures the broadcast feeds from various cities and streams them to you over the internet. This is a huge advantage. If you live in Dallas, you will not only get the Dallas local channels—you will often get the feeds from New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and more.

This is especially useful for watching sports blackouts, as you can just switch to the feed from a different city.

## How to Find Your Local Channels {#how-to-find-your-local-channels}

A 10,000-channel list can be overwhelming. Here are the two best ways to find your local stations.

### 1. The 'Local' or 'USA/UK/CA' Category {#find-local-category}

Your provider will almost always have a channel group named "USA Local," "CA Locals," or "UK Locals." Open this category to see all the affiliate feeds, usually organized by city.

### 2. The 'Favorites' List {#find-favorites-list}

The best way to manage your channels is to use the "Favorites" feature. Spend five minutes finding your local channels, mark each one as a "Favorite," and they will all appear in your short, clean "Favorites" list for easy access.

Our service includes a comprehensive list of local affiliates. You can browse our full lineup on the [channels and features](/channels-features) page.
