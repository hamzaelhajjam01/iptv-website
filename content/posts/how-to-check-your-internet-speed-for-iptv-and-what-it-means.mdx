faqs:
  - q: "Is 10 Mbps fast enough for IPTV?"
    a: "It's very risky. While a single HD stream may only use 5-8 Mbps, you need 'headroom' for stability. We recommend a minimum stable speed of 25 Mbps."
  - q: "Does upload speed matter for IPTV streaming?"
    a: "No. Upload speed is only used for sending data (like on a video call or uploading a file). IPTV is a download-only activity, so upload speed doesn't affect buffering."
  - q: "Why is my Wi-Fi speed so much slower than my ethernet speed?"
    a: "This is normal. Wi-Fi signals lose strength over distance and through walls. An ethernet cable provides a direct, wired connection with almost zero speed loss."
  - q: "What is 'Jitter' on a speed test?"
    a: "Jitter is a measure of your connection's stability. A low jitter (under 20ms) is excellent. A high jitter means your connection is unstable, which will cause buffering even if your download speed is high."

When your IPTV stream is buffering, the first thing everyone says is, "Check your internet!" But running a speed test on your phone is not enough. You need to run the test *on your streaming device* and understand what the numbers actually mean.

This guide explains how to properly test your speed and what to look for.

## What Speed Do You *Really* Need for IPTV? {#what-speed-do-you-really-need}

Here are the minimum *stable* download speeds we recommend:
* **HD (1080p) Streams:** 25 Mbps
* **4K (UHD) Streams:** 50 Mbps

While a single HD stream might only use 5-8 Mbps, you need "headroom." Your speed fluctuates, and other devices on your network use bandwidth. 25 Mbps provides a safe buffer.

## How to Check Your Speed (The Right Way) {#how-to-check-speed-the-right-way}

Don't use your phone. You must test the speed on the device that is actually streaming.
1.  On your Firestick or Android TV Box, go to the app store.
2.  Search for and install an app called **"Speedtest by Ookla"** or "Analiti."
3.  Open the app and run the test.

This will show you the *actual* speed your streaming box is receiving, which is often much lower than your phone's speed, especially on Wi-Fi.

## Understanding Your Speed Test Results {#understanding-your-speed-test-results}

You'll see three numbers. Here's what they mean for streaming.

### Download Speed (The Most Important) {#result-download-speed}

This is your "horsepower." It's how fast you can pull data from the internet. This number should be comfortably above the 25 Mbps (for HD) or 50 Mbps (for 4K) minimums.

### Ping / Latency (Response Time) {#result-ping-latency}

This is how long it takes for your device to get a "response" from the server. For streaming, this is not very important, but a lower number is always better (e.g., under 100ms).

### Jitter (The 'Stability' Score) {#result-jitter}

This is the **secret killer** of IPTV streams. Jitter measures the *consistency* of your connection.
* **Low Jitter (0-20ms):** Excellent. Your connection is stable.
* **High Jitter (50ms+):** Bad. Your internet speed is "spiky." It's "fast-slow-fast-slow." These "slow" spikes are what cause buffering, even if your download speed looks high.

## What to Do if Your Speed is Too Slow {#what-to-do-if-speed-is-slow}

If your download speed is low or your jitter is high, here are your options:
1.  **Switch to an Ethernet Cable:** This is the #1 fix. It will dramatically increase speed and lower jitter.
2.  **Move Your Router:** If you must use Wi-Fi, move your router closer to your streaming device, with no walls in between.
3.  **Upgrade Your Plan:** If you are on an old, slow plan (like 10 Mbps), you will need to call your ISP and upgrade.
4.  **Use a VPN:** If your speed is fast but jitter is high, your ISP may be "shaping" your traffic. A VPN can smooth this out.

If you're still confused by your results, our team at the [Help Center](/help) can help you analyze them.
