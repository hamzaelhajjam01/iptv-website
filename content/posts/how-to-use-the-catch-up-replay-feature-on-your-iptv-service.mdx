faqs:
  - q: "What's the difference between Catch-Up and VOD?"
    a: "VOD (Video on Demand) is a fixed library of movies and TV show series. Catch-Up is a time-limited feature (e.g., 3-7 days) that lets you 'rewind' the live TV guide and replay shows that have already aired."
  - q: "Why doesn't the Catch-Up feature work on all channels?"
    a: "Catch-Up is a server-side feature that providers must enable for specific channels. It's common for premium sports, news, and entertainment channels to have it, while less popular or 24/7-loop channels may not."
  - q: "How far back does Catch-Up usually go?"
    a: "This varies by provider, but the most common duration is 3, 5, or 7 days of replay. This allows you to 'catch up' on anything you missed during the week."

One of the most powerful, yet often overlooked, features of a premium IPTV service is "Catch-Up," also known as "Replay." This feature acts like a cloud-based DVR, allowing you to watch television programs that have *already aired* without ever having to set a recording.

This guide explains what Catch-Up is and how you can use it to never miss your favorite show again.

## What is IPTV Catch-Up? {#what-is-iptv-catch-up}

IPTV Catch-Up is a server-side feature that automatically records live programming for a set number of days (usually 3 to 7).

This means if you missed the big game last night or forgot to watch a show from two days ago, you can simply open your TV guide, scroll *back* in time, and play it as if it were an on-demand movie.

## How Does Catch-Up Work? {#how-does-catch-up-work}

Your IPTV provider dedicates massive server-side storage to record the streams from specific channels. This recording is done automatically 24/7. When you select a past program from the EPG (Electronic Program Guide), the server simply finds that recording and streams it to you, just like any other VOD.

## How to Use the Catch-Up Feature {#how-to-use-catch-up}

Using Catch-Up is incredibly simple and is done entirely through your EPG.

### Step 1: Open Your EPG (TV Guide) {#step-1-open-epg}

Open your IPTV player (like TiviMate or IPTV Smarters) and pull up the full-screen Electronic Program Guide (EPG).

### Step 2: Look for the 'Replay' or 'Catch-Up' Icon {#step-2-look-for-icon}

In your EPG, you will notice that some channels have a small icon next to their name (often a "replay" arrow or a "clock" icon). This icon signals that the channel has Catch-Up enabled.

### Step 3: Select and Play {#step-3-select-and-play}

1.  Navigate to a channel that has the Catch-Up icon.
2.  Scroll *left* (or *up*, depending on your guide) to go back in time. You can typically go back several days.
3.  Find the program you missed and select it.
4.  A new "Play" or "Watch Replay" option will appear. Select it.

The program will start playing from the beginning, just as if you had recorded it yourself.

## Does Every Channel Have Catch-Up? {#does-every-channel-have-catch-up}

No. Because it requires significant server storage, providers usually enable Catch-Up for the most popular channels. This typically includes:
* Premium Sports channels
* Major Movie channels
* Popular News and Entertainment networks

The Catch-Up feature is one of the many premium [channels and features](/channels-features) that separate a high-quality service from a basic one. It gives you the flexibility of VOD with the timeliness of live TV.
