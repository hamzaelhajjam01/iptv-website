faqs:
  - q: "What is ISP throttling?"
    a: "ISP throttling is the intentional slowing of your internet speed by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). They target specific types of traffic, like streaming or torrents, especially during peak hours."
  - q: "Is it legal for my ISP to throttle my connection?"
    a: "Yes. In most countries, it is legal. Many ISP 'Terms of Service' include a 'fair use' policy that allows them to manage network congestion by slowing down high-bandwidth users."
  - q: "Will a faster internet plan stop throttling?"
    a: "No. Throttling is not about your plan's maximum speed; it's about the type of traffic. They will throttle a 1 Gbps plan just as they will a 50 Mbps plan if they detect IPTV traffic."
  - q: "How do I know for sure if I'm being throttled?"
    a: "Run a speed test. Then, turn on a VPN and run the speed test again. If your speed is significantly faster with the VPN on, you are 100% being throttled."

Does this sound familiar? Your internet is fast all day, but at 8:00 PM, right when you want to stream, your IPTV service starts to buffer. You run a speed test, and it's fast. What's going on?

The answer is almost certainly **ISP Throttling**.

## What is ISP Throttling? {#what-is-isp-throttling}

ISP Throttling is the intentional, targeted slowing of your internet connection by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). They don't slow down *all* your internet; they just slow down *specific types* of traffic, like P2P (torrents) and, most commonly, video streaming from services they don't own.

## Why Does My ISP Throttle IPTV? {#why-does-isp-throttle-iptv}

There are two reasons:

1.  **Network Congestion:** During "peak hours" (usually 7 PM - 11 PM), everyone in your neighborhood is streaming. Your ISP slows down high-bandwidth users (like you) to provide a more stable (but slower) experience for everyone.
2.  **Anti-Competitive:** Many ISPs (like Comcast, Rogers, and Sky) also *sell* their own cable and streaming packages. They have a direct financial incentive to make competing services, like IPTV, work poorly.

## The Telltale Signs: How to Know You're Being Throttled {#how-to-know-you-are-throttled}

* Your buffering *only* happens at night or on weekends (peak hours).
* Your stream buffers, but when you run a speed test (like Ookla), it says your speed is fast. (This is because ISPs don't throttle speed test servers).
* Other services, like YouTube or Netflix, might work fine, but your IPTV stream struggles.

## How to Prove You Are Being Throttled (The VPN Test) {#how-to-prove-throttling}

This is the definitive test.
1.  Run a speed test (e.g., `fast.com`, which is powered by Netflix) and note your speed.
2.  Turn **ON** a reputable VPN.
3.  Run the speed test *again* while connected to the VPN.

If your speed is significantly *faster* with the VPN on, you have 100% proof that your ISP was throttling your connection.

## The Only Way to Stop ISP Throttling {#how-to-stop-throttling}

You cannot call your ISP and ask them to stop. The only solution is to use a **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**.

A VPN encrypts your internet traffic. This means your ISP can see *that* you are using data, but they cannot see *what* you are doing. They can't tell the difference between you streaming IPTV and you browsing a secure website.

**If they can't see your IPTV stream, they can't throttle it.**

This is why a VPN is the single most important tool for a stable IPTV experience. For more details, see our guide on the [best VPN for IPTV streaming](/blog/best-vpn-for-iptv).
