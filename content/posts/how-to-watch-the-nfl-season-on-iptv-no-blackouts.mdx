For NFL fans, the season is a frustrating mix of expensive packages, confusing broadcast rights, and annoying local blackouts. You pay for NFL Sunday Ticket, but you still can't watch your local team. You want to watch Monday Night Football, but that's on ESPN.

IPTV solves this problem by consolidating every single game into one simple service.

## The Problem: NFL Blackouts and Expensive Packages {#the-problem-nfl-blackouts}

The NFL's broadcast model is fragmented. Your local FOX/CBS affiliate gets the home games, NBC gets Sunday Night Football, ESPN gets Monday Night, and YouTube TV gets NFL Sunday Ticket for out-of-market games. This forces you to buy multiple, expensive services.

Worse, "blackouts" mean that even with these packages, you may still be blocked from watching your local team.

## The IPTV Solution: Every Game, Every Market {#the-iptv-solution}

A premium IPTV service bundles all these sources into one. It gives you access to the channel feeds from *every* major US city.

## What You Get: Sunday Ticket, RedZone, and More {#what-you-get-nfl}

### 1. NFL Sunday Ticket (Out-of-Market Games) {#feature-nfl-sunday-ticket}

IPTV effectively includes the NFL Sunday Ticket package. Since you get the FOX and CBS feeds from every city, you can choose to watch the Dallas Cowboys feed, the New York Giants feed, or the Green Bay Packers feed. You are no longer restricted to just your local game.

### 2. NFL RedZone {#feature-nfl-redzone}

NFL RedZone is a "must-have" channel for fans, and it is a standard part of almost every premium IPTV service. You can watch every touchdown from every Sunday game live.

### 3. Local & National Games (FOX, CBS, NBC, ESPN) {#feature-local-games}

All the national broadcast channels are included. This means you get:
* **Sunday Day Games** (FOX, CBS)
* **Sunday Night Football** (NBC)
* **Monday Night Football** (ESPN)
* **Thursday Night Football** (Amazon Prime Video)

## How IPTV Bypasses Blackouts {#how-iptv-bypasses-blackouts}

This is the best part. A "blackout" only applies to your local broadcast area.

If the Eagles game is blacked out in Philadelphia, you simply open your IPTV guide, go to the "ABC" or "FOX" affiliate for a different city (like New York or Boston), and watch the game from that feed. With IPTV, blackouts no longer exist.
