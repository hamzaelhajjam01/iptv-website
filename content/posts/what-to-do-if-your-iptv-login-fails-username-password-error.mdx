faqs:
  - q: "Are IPTV logins case-sensitive?"
    a: "Yes, almost all IPTV logins are case-sensitive. 'User123' is a different username from 'user123'. This is the most common reason for login failure."
  - q: "What if I lost my password or login details?"
    a: "If you lost your login credentials, you must contact your IPTV provider's support team. They can look up your account and resend your details. You can contact our team at our [Help Center](/help)."
  - q: "My account is 'locked,' what does that mean?"
    a: "This often happens if you use your subscription on too many devices at once. Most plans are for one device. If you're locked out, you may need to wait 15 minutes or ask your provider to reset your connection."
  - q: "Why did my login suddenly stop working?"
    a: "If your login was working and suddenly stopped, it almost always means your subscription has expired. Check your last payment date or contact your provider to see if your [pricing](/pricing) plan needs to be renewed."

You've just received your IPTV credentials, you enter them into your app, and... **"Error: Invalid Username or Password."** This is the most common problem new users face, and 99% of the time, it's a simple typo.

Here's how to troubleshoot your login and what to do if it fails.

## The #1 Reason Your Login Fails: Typos {#reason-1-typos}

When you use the "Xtream Codes API" login, you have to enter three details: Username, Password, and Server URL. All three must be **100% accurate.**

* **Case-Sensitivity:** `User123` is **NOT** the same as `user123`.
* **Special Characters:** `P@ssword!` is **NOT** the same as `Password!`.
* **Spaces:** A space at the beginning or end of a field will cause the login to fail.

## How to Troubleshoot Your Login (Step-by-Step) {#how-to-troubleshoot-login}

### Step 1: Check for Typos (Case-Sensitive!) {#step-1-check-typos}

Copy and paste your credentials directly from your welcome email if you can. If you're typing them, be meticulous. Use the "Show Password" (eye icon) in your app to see what you are typing.

### Step 2: Check for Extra Spaces {#step-2-check-spaces}

When using an on-screen remote, it's very easy to add an accidental space at the *end* of your password or username. Go to each field, delete the last character, and re-type it to be sure.

### Step 3: Check Your Server URL {#step-3-check-server-url}

This is the other major failure point. The Server URL must be perfect.
* It **must** start with `http://`.
* It **must** include the port number at the end, like `:1234`.
* It **must** not have a space at the end.
* **Wrong:** `myserver.com:1234`
* **Right:** `http://myserver.com:1234`

### Step 4: Check if Your Account is Active {#step-4-check-account-active}

If your login was working yesterday but not today, your subscription may have expired. Most IPTV services are prepaid. Check your email for renewal notices or log in to your account on the provider's website. You can review our [pricing](/pricing) plans to see subscription options.

### Step 5: Contact Support {#step-5-contact-support}

If you have double- and triple-checked everything and are 100% sure your details are correct, it's time to contact support. Our team at the [Help Center](/help) can verify your login from our end, check your account status, and even reset your password if needed.
