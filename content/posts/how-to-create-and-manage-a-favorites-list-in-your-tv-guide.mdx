The best part of an IPTV service is the massive number of channels. The *worst* part of an IPTV service is the massive number of channels. Scrolling through 10,000+ channels to find your local news is a nightmare.

This is where the **"Favorites"** feature becomes the most important tool in your app.

## The Problem: 10,000 Channels is Too Many {#the-problem-too-many-channels}

When you first log in, you see *everything*: all channel groups from all countries. You may have to scroll past 500 UK channels and 300 German channels just to get to your local US stations. This is slow and frustrating.

## The Solution: The 'Favorites' Feature {#the-solution-the-favorites-feature}

The "Favorites" feature lets you build your *own* personal channel guide. You can spend 10 minutes, one time, scrolling through the full list and "tag" the 30-40 channels you actually watch.

Once you do this, you'll have a new channel group at the top of your list called **"Favorites"**. From now on, you can just stay in that group and see *only* the channels you care about, in the order you want.

## How to Add/Remove Favorites in IPTV Smarters Pro {#how-to-iptv-smarters}

IPTV Smarters makes this easy.
* **To Add:** From the EPG (TV Guide) or the channel list, highlight a channel you want to add. **Press and hold** the "OK" (or "Select") button on your remote. A new menu will pop up. Select **"Add to Favorites"**. A star icon will appear.
* **To Remove:** Do the same thing. Press and hold "OK" on a favorited channel, and select **"Remove from Favorites"**.

## How to Add/Remove Favorites in TiviMate {#how-to-tivimate}

TiviMate is even faster.
* **To Add:** From the EPG, highlight a channel. Simply **press the "Menu" button** (the 3 horizontal lines) on your remote. A star icon will appear next to the channel. It's now a favorite.
* **To Remove:** Highlight the channel and press the "Menu" button again to toggle the star off.

## How to View Your Favorites List {#how-to-view-favorites-list}

After you've added at least one channel, go back to your "Channel Groups" list (where you see "USA," "UK," "Sports," etc.). A new group will be at the very top called **"Favorites"** or **"All Favorites"**. Select this group, and you will now see your own personal, clean TV guide.

This is the single best way to make your service easy to use. If you need help finding this feature, check our [Help Center](/help).
